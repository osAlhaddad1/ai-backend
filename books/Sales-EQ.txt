FOREWORD
Air Force Colonel John Boyd, the man who popularized the observe, orient, decide, and
act (OODA) loop and perhaps America's Sun Tzu, admonished a U.S. Department of
Defense enamored with technology to put certain priorities in the right order. He insisted
on “People. Ideas. Technology. In that order.”
Boyd believed strongly that people come first. Technology, therefore, serves people and
ideas. Technology isn't and cannot be a substitute for human beings and their
resourcefulness, creativity, and ability to forge and leverage relationships.
In a day and age when technology is disrupting and disintermediating entire industries
and radically changing life as we know it, there are still a few of us willing to remind you
of what's most important—especially when it comes to sales and commercial
relationships.
At a time when many technology companies and pundits (usually with an ulterior
motive) suggest that “people” are no longer how the game of sales is won or lost, that
technology is what matters most, Jeb Blount comes forward with Sales EQ. This
extraordinary message about sales-specific emotional intelligence and human
relationships will radically improve your sales results and change the way you look at
sales.
In Sales EQ, you will gain a deeper understanding of human psychology and influence
frameworks. You'll take a journey inside your mind to understand the cognitive biases
and disruptive emotions that hold you back in interpersonal relationships and undo your
efforts to win deals.
More important, Jeb doesn't leave you hanging with theory. He gives you a precise
prescription for leveraging sales-specific emotional intelligence (Sales EQ) to reach
ultra-high sales performance—the highest earning echelon of the sales profession.
Jeb believes, correctly so, that ultra-high sales performance begins with taking control
of your emotions and mastering the psychology of influence within the scope of the
sales and buying processes. Selling is about influencing change, and that starts with
changing you and then helping your clients move past status quo.
As you delve deeply into Sales EQ, you are going to understand why psychology is far
more important than technology. You'll gain insight into why your prospective clients
take certain actions—or refuse to take those actions—and how to deftly influence their
behaviors to increase the probability of closing the deal.
This is one of the most important books on sales in the past two decades, and there
isn't a better person to have written it. Jeb is a practitioner. What he teaches here is not
theory, even though he provides the latest research in neuroscience and human
psychology.
What is contained between the covers of this book can only come from someone who
has sold and succeeded as an ultra-high performer, and someone who helps

salespeople and sales organizations accelerate sales results by making massive sales
productivity improvements.
If you've wondered why ultra-high performers produce greater results than their peers,
you are holding all the answers in your hand. It's not what they sell, it's how they sell. If
you are seeking a true competitive advantage that will set you apart in the sales
profession, follow Jeb's recipe carefully, and you'll soon take your place among the
ultra-high performers.
—Anthony Iannarino, author of The Only Sales Guide You'll Ever Need and publisher of
The Sales Blog

THE MYSTERIOUS BROWN BAG
It is the dim haze of mystery that adds enchantment to pursuit.
—Antoine Rivarol
At the young age of 23, Art had just landed a huge promotion or, in his words,
“Somebody left the company, and I got lucky.”
As a lease sales representative, he worked with complex, long-cycle deals, not the
typical sales role handed to wet-behind-the-ears 23-year-olds. Fortunately, Art had two
things in his favor: an unequaled drive to succeed and a great mentor.
His mentor and sales manager was a company legend. Joe had his name etched on
pretty much every award the company bestowed and on many of the largest customers
in the organization's account base. Joe appreciated Art's willingness to learn and took
him under his wing.
“To me, at that young age, Joe looked ancient,” Art jokes. “He'd been around forever.
But he knew the answers to every question and where to find any tidbit of information;
and, boy, did he know how to talk to customers.”
It was Joe who taught Art one of the most valuable lessons of his young career: You
must learn to speak your prospect's language, because people buy for their reasons,
not yours.

The Lesson of a Lifetime
Art had been working on a deal with a local bakery. Everything was going along without
a hitch until Art presented his pricing.
“Mr. Colaizzi, the owner, was adamant that my rates were too high, and he wouldn't
budge from his position. I'd been going back and forth trying to convince him that, even
though my rates were a little higher than my competitors', the added value from the
quality of our service was more than worth it. But I was getting nowhere.
“He kept throwing the competitors' low prices in my face, but I was in a tight spot. If I
went any lower, I wouldn't make a dime of commission. Worse, I'd have to get approval
from my district manager—not a pleasant experience.
“During a pipeline review with Joe, I explained that the Colaizzi deal was stalled, and
expressed my frustration with our high rates. If we didn't get our prices in line with our
competitors', I was never going to be able to sell anything!”
Art smiles as he explains that he might have been “just a little bit hotheaded back then,”
and tells the story of how Joe taught him an indelible lesson:
Joe didn't flinch. He just stood up and said, “Come on.” We walked out to his car, and
he motioned for me to get in.

Then Joe drives us to a local grocery store, parks the car, and says, “Wait here.” Ten
minutes later he comes out carrying a brown paper bag. He stuffs it in the backseat,
puts the car in drive, and off we go.
A half hour later we're sitting in the lobby of the Colaizzi Baking Company waiting for Mr.
Colaizzi to arrive, the mysterious brown bag perched on Joe's lap.
After a 20-minute or so wait, an assistant ushers us into Mr. Colaizzi's office—the brown
bag clutched in Joe's hand.
I didn't know what to expect. Joe had barely spoken to me since we'd gotten into his
car, and I was nervous about his intentions.
We sat down across from Mr. Colaizzi's desk, and Joe started the conversation in a
relaxed, almost nonchalant tone: “Mr. Colaizzi, Art tells me he's been working with you
on a truck leasing program for your delivery fleet. He says you feel that our rates are a
bit too high, and I came down here to learn more.”
Then, he shut up.
Mr. Colaizzi leaned back in his chair, crossed his arms, and said, “I appreciate that you
took the time to come all the way down here, but the fact is your rates aren't a ‘bit’
higher; they're way higher than your competitors'. You aren't even close. I know you're
going to say that your service and quality are better. You can save your breath because
I've heard it all before. All of you truck companies are the same. If you can't get your
prices in line with your competitors', we don't have anything to talk about.”
Joe wasn't the least bit ruffled. He placed the brown bag on Mr. Colaizzi's desk, slowly
unfolded the top, and pulled two loaves of bread out of the bag. Joe set the bag on the
floor and placed the loaves directly in front of Mr. Colaizzi.
Joe allowed the silence to hang in the air for just a moment before speaking. “Mr.
Colaizzi, I'm just curious. What's the difference between this loaf of supermarket brand
white bread that costs sixty-three cents and this loaf of Colaizzi Italian bread that costs
a dollar eighty-seven cents? What makes it worth three times as much?”
Mr. Colaizzi jumped up, pushed his chair back, leaned over his desk, and spent the next
10 minutes lecturing us on why his bread was better—his passion for his bread and
reputation on full display.
He explained that his bread was fresher, that it was made from higher-quality
ingredients, the care that went into making it, the unique baking process, his family's
recipe, the history of Colaizzi bread, and the taste. The taste was “so much better than
mass-produced bread”—his face twisted in disgust as he said the words—“with all of
those artificial ingredients. That stuff's more like cardboard than bread.”
When he felt that we'd been sufficiently educated on the superiority of Colaizzi Italian
bread, he sat back down.
Joe leaned across the desk, picked up the loaf of Colaizzi bread, and said, “Mr.
Colaizzi, that's exactly what we've been trying to tell you about us. We are the Colaizzi
bread of truck leasing!”

For an interminable moment, Joe and Mr. Colaizzi just sat there staring at each other.
I didn't breathe.
Then a grin spread across Mr. Colaizzi's face, and he let go of a big laugh. He reached
out and shook Joe's hand. There were still a few concessions to make, but we walked
out with a signed contract and a new customer. We no longer looked the same as our
competitors.
Today Art Vallely is COO of Penske Truck Leasing. He's one of the most gifted and
dynamic leaders I know—an executive who gets it. He puts a high priority on sales and
sales training. He's the only C-level executive I work with who spends time with every
sales training class from entry-level sales reps in basic sales training to veteran sales
professionals who are attending advanced training.
Art passes on lessons, like the one Joe taught him, to his sales professionals to help
them understand that the key to being an ultra-high performer (UHP) in sales is
mastering emotions, interpersonal skills, and human relationships.

A Front-Row Seat into the Mind of a UHP
In Mr. Colaizzi's mind, all truck companies were the same. Why wouldn't he believe
this? He had endured multiple truck leasing sales pitches that all sounded the same,
marketing brochures and collateral that looked the same, and proposals that offered the
same promises.
To Mr. Colaizzi, a truck was a truck was a truck. Inside this pattern of sameness, Mr.
Colaizzi shifted into his reflex buyer script—“Your price is too high.” From a purely
cognitive standpoint, his response was an easy mental shortcut for dealing with the
complexity of sorting out the real differences between the vendors.
Average salespeople play into and conform to buyer scripts by responding in kind. They
become defensive, they argue, or they fold. In the process, they lose control and lower
deal win probabilities.
But Joe didn't play by the same rules as average salespeople. He reached into his
mysterious brown paper bag and changed the game—leveraging simple, but powerful,
influence frameworks.


In response to Mr. Colaizzi's buyer script, Joe leveraged a
noncomplementary response.



This disrupted Mr. Colaizzi's expectations for how a salesperson would
behave, pulling Mr. Colaizzi's attention toward Joe.



Mr. Colaizzi took the stage to defend his position and lecture Art and Joe on
why Colaizzi bread was better than supermarket bread.



As Mr. Colaizzi began talking about his bread, it kicked off a self-disclosure
dopamine loop in his brain that rewarded him for talking. He felt good, even
though his conscious self didn't know why.



As Joe and Art listened intently to the lecture and gave their complete
attention, it made Mr. Colaizzi feel important (the most powerful gift you can
give another person). This created a feeling of obligation in Mr. Colaizzi.



In the process of lecturing Art and Joe, Mr. Colaizzi became more committed
to his position that his bread was better than the competition.



Joe touched both wires to the emotional trigger by speaking in Mr. Colaizzi's
language: That's exactly what we've been trying to tell you about us. We are
the Colaizzi bread of truck leasing.



Using Mr. Colaizzi's language caused him to feel that Joe understood him,
creating a powerful emotional connection and trust.



Mr. Colaizzi had committed to the position that his bread was different. To
then refute Joe's claim that his truck leasing service was also different would
be inconsistent. This incongruence would cause painful mental stress called
cognitive dissonance.



All Mr. Colaizzi could do was smile and agree when Joe made his case.



The feeling of obligation Mr. Collaizzi felt when Joe and Art made him feel
important caused him to want to reciprocate, which opened the door to
negotiation. A deal was then struck that was fair to both parties.

Average salespeople delude themselves into believing that buyers make rational, logical
decisions based on empirical data and information. But that's not how the human mind
works. Emotions come first, then logic.
Rather than fold like a cheap lawn chair and lower the price, Joe managed his own
disruptive emotions and flipped the buyer script, “Your price is too high.” He then
shaped the decision process until it became virtually impossible for Mr. Colaizzi to make
any decision other than yes.

2
A PERFECT SALES STORM
Your chances of getting struck by lightning go up if you stand under a tree, shake your
fist at the sky, and say “Storms suck!”
—Johnny Carson
The sales profession is in the midst of a perfect storm. Buyers have more power—more
tools, more information, more at stake, and more control over the sales process than at
any time in history.
Technology is accelerating disruptive change at an ever-increasing pace, creating fear
and insecurity that leaves buyers clinging to the status quo. Technology also serves the
purpose of lowering barriers to entry, thus releasing a relentless onslaught of “me-too”
competitors. Differentiating on the attributes of products, services, or prices is fleeting at
best and more difficult than ever before.
To buyers, it all looks the same.
Legions of salespeople and their leaders are coming face-to-face with a cold, hard truth:
what once gave salespeople a competitive edge—controlling the sales process,
command of product knowledge, an arsenal of technology, and a great pitch—are no
longer guarantees of success.
Meanwhile, buyers have lost all patience for kitchen-sink data dumps of features and
benefits and canned product pitches. They expect more from their interactions with
salespeople. Buyers want to emerge from sales conversations with value beyond a
dissertation of the rep's marketing brochures.
In response to this shift in buyer expectations, salespeople are being told that they need
to offer insight, teach, challenge, and add value. However, deteriorating attention spans
have made it difficult to get buyers to sit still long enough to be given insight, taught,
challenged, or provided with added value.
These “modern” sales concepts sound intriguing and promising on the pages of a book
or in a seminar, but land like a lead balloon in the real world with real buyers because
the majority of salespeople haven't mastered the situational awareness and emotional
intelligence to leverage these techniques effectively while maintaining human
connections.
Many of the salespeople attempting these techniques leave buyers exasperated
because the techniques just come off as self-important pitching. Salespeople are not
learning and mastering interpersonal skills. They do not understand how to engage
buyers on a human-to-human level.
Adding to the problem is an entire generation entering the workforce for whom text
messaging, e-mail, and social media posts are the preferred, arm's-length form of
communication.1 This new generation is a conundrum. They are socially aware but view
human-to-human relationships in the abstract.

In this perfect storm, it's no wonder so many salespeople are struggling. It's no wonder
that sales leaders are frustrated and more stressed out than ever. It's no wonder that
buyers are starving for authentic human interaction. And it's not surprising that most
companies are experiencing sales pipelines clogged with stalled deals, and staring
down the barrel at 50 percent or more of their salespeople missing their quotas.

Meet the Ultra-High-Performance Sales Professional
In this new paradigm, though, there is an elite group of sales professionals who are
crushing it. In this age of transparency where information is ubiquitous and buyer
attention spans are fleeting, these ultra-high performers have learned how to leverage a
new psychology of selling to keep prospects engaged, create true competitive
differentiation, and shape and influence buying decisions.
The ultra-high sales performer is acutely aware that the emotional experience of buying
from them is far more important than products, prices, features, and solutions. They
know that to sell value, they must be valuable, and they must earn the right, through
human relationships, to teach, offer insight, or challenge.
Over the course of this book, I'm going to take you on an unprecedented journey into
the behaviors and mind-sets of the highest-earning sales professionals. I'm going to
open a window into their minds and show you their techniques, frameworks, and
secrets. You'll learn how to:


Leverage human behavior frameworks, heuristics, and cognitive biases to
influence buying behaviors.



Manage and control the Disruptive Emotions that are holding you back.



Improve Sales EQ and build on the Four Intelligences required for ultra-high
performance.



Shape and align the Three Processes of Sales to lock out competitors and
shorten the sales cycle.



Influence and manage relationships with The Five Stakeholders You Meet in
a Deal.



Sales EQ begins where many of the great books and sales training programs like The
Challenger Sale, Strategic Selling, Insight Selling, and SPIN Selling leave off. It
addresses the human relationship gap in the modern sales process—the emotional side
of selling.
I want to be crystal clear about my intentions. I didn't invest a year of my life writing this
book merely to make you a better level of average. Screw average. To hell with
mediocrity.
I'm pulling back the veil from ultra-high sales performance. My mission is to move you
into the top tier of salespeople in your company, industry, and field. To help you become
insanely successful—an elite top earner.

A Note about the Word Stakeholder
Throughout the book, I use stakeholder as a generic term inclusive of buyers,
amplifiers, seekers, influencers, and coaches. These roles are also, in my work and the
work of others, defined as prospects and decision makers. For expediency and to avoid
confusion, I have chosen to use the term stakeholder.

THE IRRATIONAL BUYER
Life is simple, but we insist on making it complicated.
—Confucius
Everyone in my industry knew about the opportunity. It was a rare gem that caused my
competitors to throw everything at it. One of my competitors flew the stakeholders
around in a luxurious corporate jet to visit its manufacturing plants, wining and dining
them along the way. Another competitor feted the stakeholder group at premier sporting
events.
I agonized that we were going to lose the deal because we weren't keeping up with the
Joneses. My company didn't have the resources to entertain a large stakeholder group
like our competitors could, nor was it in our culture to do so.
Adding to my anxiety were our no-frills production facilities that were dated compared to
the competition, with their modern, state-of-the-art plants.
Honestly, it was like David going up against Goliath. But it was a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, and I had bet the farm and my reputation on closing it.

Nail-Biting Suspense
After almost two years of work, we delivered our final presentation and proposal. On the
eve of the decision I couldn't sleep. Perhaps that I was close to an all-out anxiety attack
and mental breakdown is a better description.
But the next day no word came. Then another day went by and another. I called, but no
one answered; I left messages that were not returned, and tried to pry information out of
the gatekeepers. Nothing. Crickets.
I put on a brave, relaxed face, but I was in a state of panic. In my heart I knew that no
news was bad news. After working closely with these stakeholders for so long, we'd
become friends. I knew that none of them wanted to deliver the word that we were not
the vendor of choice.
Over the next weekend, I talked myself off the ledge and came to grips with the fact that
my dream of landing the account was not going to come true. I prepared to move on,
knowing that there was a likelihood, after expending so many resources on the deal,
that I might not have a job.

The Answer
On Monday morning, I drove to the office early and prepared to start rebuilding a
pipeline that had been obliterated while I'd focused my complete attention on a single
deal.

Just a little after 8:30 my phone rang. The receptionist told me that Randy (my coach at
the account) was on the line.
“Randy, nice to hear from you! How was your weekend?” I did my best not to sound as
desperate as I felt.
“Good, Jeb. How about yours?”
“Fantastic,” I lied.
“Hey, I'm sorry I didn't return your calls.” There was no emotion in his voice. “Our team
met last week to go over the proposals, and honestly it wasn't an easy decision. All the
companies did a great job. But we made a choice, and I don't want to keep you in
suspense any longer.”
My heart was racing as I braced for the worst.
“It was unanimous.” His voice was solemn.
I could feel the bad news coming.
“We've decided to go with you guys!” He started laughing, clearly enjoying the pain he'd
caused me.

The Reason
“Thank you! That's incredible. Thank you!” I was gushing and could barely find words as
a wave of relief rushed over me.
We quickly put together a plan for the next steps and getting a contract over to his legal
team. I was anxious to get off the phone and share the good news with my wife and our
team, but, before I let him go, I asked what compelled them to pick my company.
“You know, we just felt like you guys were a lot like us.” He pointed to how much fun his
team had the day they toured our production facility.
At lunch, we shut the plant down, brought in barbecue, and ate on paper plates—his
stakeholders, our sales team, and the plant employees all mingled together. He
explained that they enjoyed spending time with our people without all the formality. His
team felt our people were down-to-earth and cared—just like them.
Closing that deal was a two-year ordeal requiring a significant investment of resources,
a team of people dedicated to the cause, and hours and hours of work on strategy,
stakeholder mapping, endless financial analysis, and extensive supply chain work to
source and customize an array of products, not to mention all the emotional anguish.
But it wasn't the six-inch-thick request for proposal (RFP) response with every
imaginable spec that closed the deal. Nor the final presentation we spent three days
and nights rehearsing. Nor the detailed implementation plan that took a week to
develop. Nor the research, demos, samples, and data. Not planes, fancy entertainment,
or sports tickets.

In the end, they felt that we were more like them than our competitors were. They felt
more comfortable with the people on our team and our company culture. They liked us
more. We were a safe choice. A pivotal decision swayed by the whim of emotion. A
similarity bias. Unquantifiable and irrational.
It was the biggest deal I'd ever closed. Huge. The commission on the account alone
was enough to purchase a 5,000-square-foot home with cash (which I did) and have
enough money left over to make a significant contribution to my savings. Just like that,
at the age of 26, I went from the depths of depression to the top of the world. Closing
that deal changed my life and set my career on the fast track.
Since then I've closed bigger and more complex deals worth millions more dollars. Yet,
no other sale taught me more about what matters most in sales. It was a humbling
lesson on why what we often believe is important to influencing the outcome of a sale is
just dead wrong.
It also put me on the path I've been on as a practitioner, leader, author, consultant,
researcher, and trainer for the past 20 years, on a mission to answer two simple, yet
frustratingly elusive, questions:
1. Why do people buy?
2. How do we influence them to buy?

To Buy Is Human
People act on emotion and justify with logic. From complex to completely transactional
impulse purchases, emotions drive buying decisions. Science is stacking up one study
after another demonstrating the leverage emotion exerts on the choices we make. The
real-life examples are legion:


A banking executive makes a $500,000 enterprise software decision
because she likes the account executive, Geoff, better than the competitor's
sale rep—she tells him she appreciated his thoughtful birthday card.



Michelle pays more for the same mattress because she feels like her sales
rep Gwen cares more about her than Ray at Gwen's competitor.



A vice president of safety and compliance at a major electrical utility makes a
million-dollar decision on safety equipment because he “just feels like he can
trust the rep he's working with.”



Carrie buys a car that is not exactly what she wants because she doesn't
want to let down the sales rep who helped her.



At a wine-tasting party, people feel that the wine with the higher price tag
tastes better even though every bottle is filled with the exact same low-cost
wine.1



John buys a stock because the company's name is easier to pronounce. 2



People choose Pepsi in a blind taste test but think Coke tastes better when
they can see the cans.3



I close my dream account because the stakeholders feel that we are similar
to them.

Daniel Pink says that to sell is human;4 likewise, to buy is human. Though as humans
we are certain that we're making choices based on rational logic, our best interests, or
organized facts, science says that we often don't.
In one research study, a liquor store played German beer hall music on Tuesdays and
French music on Wednesdays. Correspondingly, German beer sales went up on
Tuesdays, with French wine sales increasing on Wednesdays.
On the sidewalk outside the store, researchers peered into brown bags and interviewed
the patrons to learn why they purchased the beer or wine. Most of the shoppers gave
logical reasons for their purchase—saw it in a magazine, recommended by a friend,
cooking steaks tonight, like the taste of premium beer—proving that people buy on
emotion and justify with logic.
As humans, it is important that our self-image correlate with our decisions. So, we fall
on logic to justify subconscious buying behavior.
Emotion is why well-educated executives make multimillion-dollar decisions with
massive implications for their companies because they feel that one sales team cares
about them more than another. Despite all of the tools, information, and data at their
fingertips, in our Internet-connected world, buyers continue to make irrational decisions.
Am I saying that product features, quality, specs, delivery options and speed, service,
technology, locations, price, and other tangible attributes of your offering don't matter?
Of course not. These things absolutely matter. All are tickets to the game, and a
deficiency in one of these areas can eliminate you before you ever get started.
However, the sales profession, inclusive of salespeople, sales trainers, sales leaders,
and the marketing teams that support sales, are and have been under the collective
delusion that buyers make logical decisions that are in their own or their company's best
interest—that they weigh decisions rationally and objectively.
Evidence upon evidence and data stacked on data refute this assumption. Frankly, you
don't need to look far for proof.
I have no doubt that you've been frustrated with a prospect into which you've poured
heart and soul. You've built the case why they should do business with you. You've
analyzed their current situation and shown them how you can save them money, time,
and stress, and offered them better service.
In such a case, the proof was irrefutable, your references were impeccable, and there
was even a compelling trigger event to drive urgency. Yet, instead of signing your
agreement, they gave your competitor (who had taken them for granted, provided
shoddy service, pissed them off, and overbilled them for the headache) a second
chance. I know—I've been there, and it's maddening.

If we were to ask your buyer why they chose to remain with a vendor that was not
working in their best interest, they would lead off with a number of what they felt were
logical, rational reasons. But refuting and arguing the facts would get you nowhere. The
buyer would just dig in and become intractable.
What they would be unable to explain or unwilling to admit is their fear of making a
mistake; or that there was just something about you that, at the subconscious level, they
didn't trust; or that because they avoid conflict, firing the current vendor would put them
in an uncomfortable position.
Layer upon layer of emotions—conscious and subconscious—drive this irrational
choice. Yet they explain the decision in completely rational terms.

The Secret Ingredient
As a sales professional, understanding how emotions dominate and drive buying
decisions is critical to supercharging your income and advancing your career.
When all things are equal—and in today's marketplace there are rarely huge gaps or
differences between competitors (at least from the buyer's viewpoint)—your ability to
influence the emotions of stakeholders while regulating your own disruptive emotions,
as you move deals through the sales pipeline, gives you a distinct competitive edge.
If you'll just take a moment to consider the deals you've lost and won and how most
salespeople approach buyers, you'll come face-to-face with the truth:


A truth that is invisible to countless salespeople.



A truth invisible to sales trainers and experts whose house of cards begins to
fall apart when their process-based, data-driven, science of selling fallacy
meets irrational emotions.



A truth ignored by the challengers who pontificate to stakeholders about how
they're “doing it all wrong,” and the insight sellers who teach their poor,
ignorant buyers how to “do it right.”

Borrowing one of my favorite lines from the movie The Big Short, “The truth is like
poetry. But people fucking hate poetry.”
Emotions are difficult to wrap our arms around and are sometimes hard to face. It's so
much easier to pitch the features of a widget than to tune into the emotions of the
stakeholder sitting across from you. The brutal, inconvenient truth is you can pitch,
challenge, teach, and offer insight to your heart's content, but it will not matter because:
People buy for their reasons, not yours.

Approach Buyers the Way They Buy
Selling is human. Buying is human. Both pursuits are woven into the imperfect fabric of
human emotions. No matter what you sell, your sales cycle, or the complexity of the

sales and buying process, emotions play a crucial role in the outcomes of your sales
conversations, interactions, and deals.
Each time you (and the members of your selling team) and each stakeholder involved in
the buying decision meet, those emotions collide.
Most salespeople begin the sales process from a position of logic and gradually shift
toward emotion. In contrast, buyers tend to begin the buying process at the emotional
level and over time shift toward logic.
At the beginning of the sales process, the buyer is asking a basic question about the
salesperson: Do I like you? In the same moment, the seller is delivering a pitch on
product features they believe will generate interest from the buyer.
Few things make sellers more unlikable than pitching. And so it goes throughout the
buying journey. By the end of the sales process when the buyer is asking rational
questions, putting objections on the table, and negotiating, the seller is reacting
emotionally to perceived rejection, desperate not to lose the deal.
At the emotional level, the parties are perpetually out of sync (Figure 3.1).

Figure 3.1 Seller versus Buyer
Of course, I'm not blind to the oversimplification of this example. Human interaction is
complex and often nonlinear. However, dealing with people in the context of sales
conversations doesn't need to be overly complex or overwhelming.
A handful of principles and influence frameworks guide most human behavior. When
you learn to master these simple frameworks, you'll become a master of emotions,
influence, and persuasion.
I've already shared with you one of the most cogent truths in sales: People buy for their
reasons, not yours. It follows, then, that to be effective, you must approach people the
way they buy rather than the way you sell.
This new approach requires sales specific emotional intelligence—Sales EQ. Sales EQ
is the ability to manage your own disruptive emotions while at the same time accurately
interpreting and responding to the emotions of stakeholders, in the context of the sales
and buying processes. As you'll learn in the upcoming chapters, it is this emotional
control that sets ultra-high sales performers apart.

PATTERN PAINTING, COGNITIVE BIASES, AND HEURISTICS
You can't argue with the brain: it wants what it wants what it wants.
—Dr. Katherine Ramsland
Stop reading for a moment. I want you to focus on being aware of every visual, tactile,
kinesthetic, and auditory stimulus in your environment. Try to focus on the obvious to
the mundane: the color of the carpet, walls, the chair you are sitting in. Study each
person walking by you or near you: what they are wearing, their facial expressions, and
the content of their conversations. What sounds do you hear? What textures do you
feel?
Try to take it all in at once. Instantly overwhelming?
Now, imagine what it would be like if you were forced to experience this massive
sensory overload all the time. It would paralyze you.
Much like a computer, our brains can process only so much information at one time. As
the cognitive load1 grows, it slows down and becomes less efficient. The brain is unable
to focus, and attention control diminishes.
From a purely evolutionary sense, this inability to focus can put you in danger. Should
there be a threat nearby—say a saber-toothed tiger crouched in the weeds, or a bus
rolling down the street—and you are so overwhelmed with incoming sensory information
that you fail to see it, bam! You are lunch or a pancake.

Pattern Monster
Moving slowly had the tendency to remove one's DNA from the gene pool, so our brains
evolved to think fast. With so much sensory information hitting us at one time, we
needed a way to manage it and focus only on environmental anomalies that might be
dangers or opportunities.
The human brain is a pattern monster. It is a master at grabbing the billions of bits of
information in the environment around you, interpreting the patterns, and behaving
appropriately (in most cases) in response to those patterns. 2
If your brain did not leverage patterns for decision making and adaptive response to the
world around you, you'd be unable to function. Every bit of information would require
analyzing before a decision could be made. Instead, the brain uses mental shortcuts
(heuristics) to cut through the noise and make quick decisions.
A basic understanding of how these mental shortcuts work is crucial for controlling your
own behaviors and influencing the behaviors of others. Let's begin with two facts about
the brain.

1. It is tasked with keeping you alive and, therefore, focuses on things in the
environment that are unexpected and could pose a threat while ignoring
things that are the same (patterns) to ensure that it does not miss the former.
2. It is lazy, preferring the path of least resistance or cognitive load when
making decisions, which also contributes to keeping you alive. When the
brain sees a pattern, for example, that is similar to other patterns, instead of
taking the time to analyze whether the two things are different, it assumes
they are the same and uses that shortcut to make quick decisions.

Pattern Painting
If suddenly there was a loud noise nearby, your attention would be torn from these
words and pulled toward that sound. Then, your brain would begin scanning your
surroundings for anything out of place that could potentially be a threat while preparing
you to deal with that threat. This is your fight-or-flight response. For the moment, a part
of your brain called the amygdala has taken control of your emotions and behavior.
Think of the brain as a Russian nesting doll. The big doll on the outside is the
neocortex. This is your gray matter—your rational brain. The middle doll is the limbic
system—your emotional brain. The smallest doll is your cerebellum or autonomic brain
—it manages all the little (but still important) things, like breathing, so you can
concentrate on thinking.
All three brains are connected to the amygdala, which is housed in the limbic system.
The amygdala is the hub that processes all sensory input, connecting the rational,
emotional, and autonomic parts of your brain and is the center for emotions, emotional
behavior, and motivation. Fear and pleasure are the language of the amygdala, and it
exerts a massive and compulsory influence over your emotional behavior.
To avoid wasting precious resources on things that don't matter, the amygdala focuses
on and responds to environmental disruptions—different, unexpected, new, what it
deems important to your survival, both physically and socially. This simple cognitive
shortcut of ignoring boring patterns and being alert to anything that disrupts patterns is a
key reason for our success as a species.
Salespeople who disrupt expectations pull stakeholders toward them. They paint boring
sales patterns with bright colors. Pattern painting is how ultra-high performers (UHPs)
flip the buyer script and change the game. Different is sexy. Different sells. The
amygdala loves bright, shiny things.
Throughout this book are examples of how UHPs paint common patterns to disrupt
expectation and differentiate themselves.
When your sales behaviors fall into an expected pattern, you will not differentiate and
you will not garner attention. You do not create fear or promise pleasure. You are not
interesting. Your dull colors are easy to ignore.

When you look, act, feel, and sound like every other sales rep who calls, e-mails,
provides a demo, presents, pitches, challenges, or walks through the door, your
stakeholder finds you boring and shifts into their reflexive buyer script. The buyer script
is rote. Habit. The same thing the stakeholder says to every salesperson. It allows the
buyer to remain emotionally detached and to keep you at arm's length.

Mental Shortcuts
A heuristic is a mental shortcut our brains leverage to make quick decisions in the thick
of complexity—a path to an outcome that incurs the least amount of effort and cognitive
load. Heuristics help you solve problems faster than you would if you methodically
weighed all the options.3
They're also thought of as rules of thumb. For example, a simple heuristic is “Where
there's smoke, there's fire.” These cognitive shortcuts are intuitive and occur at both the
conscious and the subconscious levels. There is nothing you do or decide that is not
impacted by your brain's desire to use these mental shortcuts to make things easier. 4
Likewise, heuristics are in play as stakeholders decide if they like you, evaluate your
proposal, assess the risk of moving to the next step, determine if you are trustworthy,
and compare you to your competitors.
While heuristics aid stakeholders in working through complex problems faster, they also
lead to cognitive biases that result in emotional decision making. Rational, objective
analysis is pushed aside by the lazy brain looking for an easy way out. The irrational
buyer is born.
The power of the subconscious mind and how it holds sway over our emotions,
behavior, interpersonal interactions, likes, dislikes, perceptions, and decisions is
something every sales professional must understand and learn to leverage. We'll be
confronting how heuristics, cognitive biases, and emotions impact decision making
throughout the book.

People Act on Emotion and Justify with Logic
Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio set out to prove that emotions guide decisions. His
somatic marker hypothesis5 changed the way science viewed human decision making.
Damasio studied people whose limbic system—the emotional center of the brain—was
damaged and not working properly. In these subjects, however, the neocortex or
rational brain was in normal working condition.
He discovered that people in this condition shared a peculiar commonality. It was
almost impossible for them to decide. They could objectively discuss the logic and
rationality of different choices but when asked to make a choice they found it difficult
and sometimes impossible to choose. Without their emotions to guide them, they
agonized over even the simplest choices like whether to have a ham or turkey sandwich
for lunch.

Damasio's work demonstrated that emotions are central to human decision making and
that we often apply logic after the fact to avoid the pain of cognitive dissonance. This is
not to say that we don't make rational decisions. We certainly attempt to make decisions
that are in our best interest.
What Damasio proved, though, is that for humans, decisions begin with emotion. We
feel, and then we think.

Cognitive Dissonance
When you attempt to hold two or more contradictory beliefs in your mind at the same
time, do or think something that violates or is incongruent with a core belief or value,
take an action that is inconsistent with a prior commitment, or are confronted with
information that directly contravenes something you believe to be true, it creates mental
stress and emotional discomfort. This is cognitive dissonance.
Humans have an overriding desire to be consistent in their thoughts, beliefs, values,
and actions. To achieve this comfortable equilibrium, we constantly seek dissonance
reduction, much like hunger causes us to seek food to comfort a growling stomach. 6
Dissonance is so emotionally painful that people will, in many cases, deny facts, deny
evidence, and rationalize anything to protect a core belief.
When stakeholders are placed in situations where they must make a decision, they're
being bombarded by conscious rational choices, emotions, and subconscious cognitive
biases. Some of these biases, emotions, and rational choices are opposing and
contradictory, creating a state of dissonance. It is your ability to deftly maneuver and
navigate this emotional minefield that opens the door to influence.

Triggering Cognitive Dissonance
Situation: The stakeholder is working with a vendor that is providing bad service. You
challenge the stakeholder with evidence that his current vendor is screwing him over.
Dissonance: The stakeholder originally chose and committed to the vendor. The
stakeholder believes, like most people, that he makes good, rational decisions
(egocentric bias). You challenged his judgment by showing him that he made a poor
decision. The stakeholder is forced to either accept that he made a bad choice, blame
external circumstances (attribution bias), lie that he knew the vendor was bad all along
and had no other choice (hindsight bias), or defend his decision, turning you into an
adversary.
Result: He digs in his heels because the need to be consistent with his self-image and
past commitments is powerful. Instead of agreeing with you, he argues back, making
the case with the few good things the vendor has done for him while ignoring the
damage the vendor has caused (confirmation bias).

Most of his justifications are irrational. Yet the more you argue, the more he becomes
anchored to his position. (You cannot argue other people into believing that they are
wrong. This is the reason direct challenges often fail.)
Your challenge creates psychological discomfort. Because you are the genesis of the
pain, you become an unlikable adversary. When you are branded unlikable, win
probability plummets.

A Better Way
Gaining an understanding of and leveraging cognitive dissonance is one of the keys to
influencing stakeholder decisions.
Rather than a direct confrontation—either with empirical evidence or with badmouthing
a vendor that is clearly doing the wrong thing—create awareness with an artful
question:
“John, could you tell me what you like most about ABC vendor?”
Average salespeople feel like this is a suicide question. “Why would I want them to tell
me what they like about the vendor? Isn't that defeating the entire purpose?”
To influence the behavior of stakeholders, you must manage your disruptive emotions
(in this case fear), have empathy for the pain of cognitive dissonance, and have an
acute understanding of how the human mind works.
When you ask most people what they like about something, you trigger the negativity
effect or bias. Most people will respond with a few positives and quickly shift to
negatives. Humans are more attuned to negatives than to positives. We look for what's
wrong or out of place, rather than what is right—it's just what we do.
All you need to do is prime this behavior in your stakeholders by asking them what they
like most. This has the added effect of disrupting their expectations, thus pulling them
toward you, and causing them to become more engaged.
In this case, there are obvious negatives, making the job of getting John complaining
about the vendor and offering up a litany of its failures and shortcomings much easier.
When John expresses his dissatisfaction on his terms, he becomes committed to
making a change, and the probability that he will make the change increases because
his actions must be consistent with his new beliefs about the vendor so as to avoid
dissonance.

THE FOUR LEVELS OF SALES INTELLIGENCE
We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect. The judgment of
the intellect is only part of the truth.
—Carl Jung
There is no doubt that ultra-high performers (UHPs) are smart people. They are keen
observers and have insatiable curiosity. They have the innate ability and talent to
connect disparate ideas, data, and patterns and then leverage these mashups of
information to offer insights and solve problems.
The good news is it is highly likely that you have an above-average IQ. I know this
because people with above-average IQs are statistically more likely to read books and
seek out knowledge.
The bad news is a high IQ is not enough. Ultra-high performance requires innate
intellectual ability combined with acquired, technological, and sales-specific emotional
intelligence. These are the four types of intelligence that open the door to ultra-high
sales performance:
1. Innate intelligence (IQ)
2. Acquired intelligence (AQ)
3. Technological intelligence (TQ)
4. Emotional intelligence (EQ)

Innate Intelligence
Your intelligence quotient (IQ) is an indicator of how smart you are. Innate intelligence is
baked into your DNA. It is a talent no different than athleticism. You are either born with
a certain IQ or you are not.
IQ is immovable. In other words, you are as smart as you will ever be.
The speed and complexity of the modern marketplace is the domain of intellectual
agility. In a low-IQ versus high-IQ battle, I'll put my money on the high-IQ person any
day. It's almost impossible to be an ultra-high performer in sales, or any other career, if
you are not smart.
People with an above-average IQ tend to be curious, rapidly assimilate and learn new
information, are strategic and can see the bigger picture, hold themselves to high
standards, and have superior reasoning skills.
They also perceive relationships among seemingly unrelated objects, ideas, or facts
and develop unique and original solutions to problems from these relationships—a
critical competency in sales for discovery, challenging the status quo, and developing
unique solutions and recommendations.

These competencies (and more) are why sales professionals with above-average IQs
thrive in sales. But there is a dark side. Because high-IQ people tend to think, talk, and
connect disparate ideas faster and more rationally than other people, they have the
tendency to damage relationships through:


Impulsiveness



Impatience



Talking down to people



Talking over people



Failure to listen and hear people out



Failure to empathize with others



Overwhelming people with elaborate solutions to basic problems

To effectively navigate relationships and influence the emotions of others, you must
learn to temper and complement innate intellectual ability with emotional intelligence. In
sales, where emotions rather than rational decision making carry the day, IQ is but part
of the equation.
Many extremely intelligent people fail in the sales profession because they are unable to
influence the behaviors of other people. Likewise, there are people with high EQs and
average- or below-average IQs who thrive in sales and every aspect of life because
they are virtuosos with people.
What I know to be true is that being smart gives you a competitive edge, but it is only
one part of who you are. Innate intelligence becomes relevant, useful, and powerful
when combined with acquired, technological, and emotional intelligence.

Acquired Intelligence
A sales manager asked me, as a personal favor, to spend some time with one of his
salespeople while I was at his location on a consulting assignment. According to the
manager, the rep had lots of potential but was failing.
I met with the rep in the break room. After listening to his long list of excuses, blaming
everything and everyone beside himself for his shortcomings, I suggested a book and
two podcasts that I believed would help him. He responded, “I don't like to read, and
podcasts aren't for me.”
A week later I was delivering a two-day Sales EQ seminar for a client. On the first day, I
noticed that a couple of the participants were disengaged. The rest of the group of
roughly 20 people were participating and energetic. But these two were almost hostile.
At lunch, I asked the sales leader if there was something going on. He confided that
everyone had been excited about the training except for these two, who had complained
about having to go back to training. “They think they know it all. But trust me—these
guys need this badly because they are struggling to hit their numbers.”

Average salespeople who think they know it all—I see it every day.

A Thirst for Knowledge
Innate intellect is useless on its own. It must be honed and developed through learning,
exercise, and experience. Unlike innate intelligence, acquired intelligence (AQ) is not
static.
Regardless of your IQ, you can grow your AQ with schooling, training, reading, and
other learning experiences, along with practice, adversity, and experience. Acquired
intelligence makes IQ relevant and useful.
What makes one person invest heavily in learning while another says, “Learning is a
waste of time”?
Much of it rests on what neuroscientists refer to as locus of control. People who develop
an internal locus of control believe that they have control over their life, actions, and
situation. People who have an external locus of control believe they are at the mercy of
outside forces, luck, and chance. They believe that nothing they do will change
anything.
An internal locus of control is a key indicator of high emotional intelligence. Ultra-high
performers have an insatiable thirst for knowledge. They:


Seek out every opportunity to learn.



Are coachable.



Welcome feedback.



View adversity as a learning opportunity.

Ultra-high performers believe that they can shape and influence win probability by
investing in and making themselves better through learning and training. They believe
that one of the keys to winning is to have more knowledge about the sales profession,
their industry, and their products and services than any of their competitors.
UHPs study every move their competitors make. They take pride in knowing more about
their competitors than their competitors know about themselves. UHPs invest the time
to learn their competitors' products, sales tactics, pricing strategies, marketing,
strengths, weaknesses, and even the names of their salespeople. UHPs are not
intimidated by competitors; they intimidate competitors.
I have limited patience for salespeople who don't invest in self-development. When you
decide not to invest in yourself, you are making the conscious choice to limit your
growth and income.

Technological Intelligence
Technological intelligence (TQ) is the ability to interact with technology and weave it
seamlessly into one's daily life. Those who fail to develop this ability or who resist
developing it will be left behind.

According to Thomas Baumgartner, Homayoun Hatami, and Maria Valdivieso in their
Harvard Business Review article, “Why Salespeople Need to Develop Machine
Intelligence,” it is essential that salespeople adapt quickly to working with machines.
“Beyond their relationship skills, reps will succeed based on their ability to understand
and interpret data, work effectively with AI, and move quickly on opportunities.” 1
As technology—especially artificial intelligence—becomes a ubiquitous part of daily life,
humans with high TQ will thrive in ways that humans with low TQ will not.
Salespeople can no longer afford to claim that they are “not computer savvy.” To do so
puts you in the below-average group. If you don't get tech savvy and quickly, you will be
left behind and out of a job.
Ultra-high performers use the Three As in their approach to technology:


Adopt: UHPs tend to be early adopters of new, cutting-edge technology, and
leverage it to achieve a game-changing competitive edge. They invest in it
themselves out of their own pockets.



Adapt: UHPs adapt new technology to their unique situations. They leverage
technology to automate low-value tasks so as to gain more time for focusing
on high-value human interactions and strategies.



Adept: UHPs rapidly assimilate technology into their sales day and become
adept at using it, not because they have special abilities but rather because
they are open to it, have the courage to experiment and learn, and seek out
on-demand learning resources.

In the future, there will be two types of salespeople. The first group will tell machines
what to do. The second group will be told what to do by machines. Trust me, you want
to be in the first group.

Emotional Intelligence
The ability to perceive, correctly interpret, respond to, and effectively manage your own
emotions and influence the emotions of others is called emotional intelligence (EQ).
I've been obsessed with emotional intelligence and human behavior in the workplace for
20 years. For me it began with Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can
Matter More Than IQ (Bantam, 1995). This seminal book took emotional intelligence
from the obscurity of academics and introduced it into the mainstream.
Today, the impact of sales-specific emotional intelligence on sales performance can no
longer be ignored. Buyers are starving for authentic human interaction. In our techdominated society, interpersonal skills (responding to and managing the emotions of
others) and intrapersonal skills (managing your own disruptive emotions) are more
essential to success in sales than at any point in history.
Emotional intelligence is the key that unlocks ultra-high performance. EQ offsets
deficiencies in the other types of intelligence. The awareness and understanding of

human influence frameworks, along with the ability to manage your own disruptive
emotions, is the rocket fuel of sales performance.
Sales professionals who invest in developing and improving EQ gain a decisive
competitive advantage in the hypercompetitive global marketplace.

IQ + AQ + TQ + EQ—A Powerful Combination
What is certain is that the four types of intelligence are tightly intertwined, each
connecting, affecting, and amplifying the others. Let's review:


IQ—how smart you are—is fixed. It is baked into your DNA.



AQ—how much you know—makes IQ relevant.



TQ—how fast you assimilate and leverage technology for low-value tasks—
gives you more time for human relationships.



EQ—your acuity for dealing with emotions—amplifies the impact of IQ, AQ,
and TQ because it allows you to relate, respond to, influence, and persuade
other human beings.

People who combine high IQ, AQ, and TQ with high EQ dominate any field or discipline
they pursue. In business and in life, these “high Q” people are at the very top of the food
chain while “low Q” people barely scrape by.

SHAPING WIN PROBABILITY
The probable is what usually happens.
—Aristotle
There is not a one-size-fits-all solution for every sales situation. Complex sales are
different from one-call closes. Calling on a business is different from selling a car.
Selling software requires a different skill set than selling office automation equipment.
In sales, context matters. Every prospect, sales conversation, territory, company, and
product is different and requires salespeople to adapt and adjust to those unique
situations.
There is no black and white. There is no easy button that will make sales work perfectly
every time. In some situations, you'll do something completely inappropriate and still
manage to close the deal. In others, you'll run the sales process like a textbook and fall
flat on your face.
It's what I find so beautiful about sales. There are no guarantees, no magic pills, no holy
grail. There is only poetry and probability.

Poetry
There is poetry in emotion. It is the glue that connects all the disparate elements of the
sales equation. Emotion is sales process agnostic. It influences sales outcomes across
industry verticals, deal complexity, inside sales or field sales, any product or service,
and in both business-to-business and consumer environments.
It's the ability to manage and leverage emotion to create the highest statistical chance of
winning that separates ultra-high performers (UHPs) from everyone else. Your ability to
shape and influence win probabilities is the only reason you have a job.
Consider a potential buyer opening your company's website to look for a product; if,
when they open the product page, the probability that they click a buy button, enter a
credit card, and make a purchase is north of 80 percent, you would be unemployed.
Your company would need only to focus its attention on getting more potential buyers to
that page.
Purely transactional purchases don't require salespeople to shape the win probability.
However, the more complex the sale, the longer the sales cycle, the higher the dollar
amount, the greater the risk to the stakeholders, and the more emotions are involved in
the decision to purchase, the more companies need salespeople who are intelligent,
creative, insightful, influential, and persuasive to shift win probabilities in the
organization's favor.

Win Probability Is the First Rule of Ultra-High Sales Performance
Imagine that you are standing in the doorway to a large room. At the far end are two
identical dollar slot machines. As you walk in, the room attendant hands you a single
dollar coin. You are offered the choice to play either machine or simply give the dollar
coin back and walk away. If you choose to play, you get to keep the original coin plus
any winnings.
With nothing to lose, you decide to play.
As you walk toward the machines, you notice something curious. Above each one there
is a sign with a number on it. One sign reads 93 and the other 33. You turn back to the
room attendant and ask, while pointing up at the signs, “What do those numbers
mean?”
“Smart of you to ask,” the attendant replies, smiling. “Most people never do.”
He continues, “Those signs indicate the win probability of each machine. On the first
machine, you have a 93 percent probability that you will win your dollar back plus more.
With the second machine, you have only a 33 percent chance of winning.”
Which machine will you choose?
Of course, it's a no-brainer. The smart bet is on the machine that gives you the highest
probability of winning.
Managing probability is how ultra-high performers play sales.
Admittedly, sales would be much easier if there were signs over prospects indicating
win probability. But alas, prospects are not slot machines and, unlike slot machines, in
sales win probability is fluid, complex, influenced by many different variables, and
impossible to know with certainty until, of course, the deal is lost or won.
For this reason, ultra-high performers take nothing for granted. They're constantly
checking, testing, and analyzing where they stand with the opportunities in their
pipeline. UHPs are perfectionists, managing every element within their control to shape,
influence, and bend the win probability curve in their favor.
There are five levers UHPs pull to shape win probability:
1. Fanatical prospecting
2. Disciplined qualifying
3. Stakeholder mapping
4. Alignment of the three processes of sales
5. Sales-specific emotional intelligence and human influence frameworks
It's important to clarify that win probability is not the same as a deal's progress through
the sales process or percent to closed—measures that are often used to quantify sales
pipelines for forecast purposes.

Indicating that you are 70 percent of the way through the sales process because you
completed the final demo does not mean you have a 70 percent probability of closing
the deal. It just means you have progressed that far into the sales process.
This is how most sales forecasts are built and why so many of those forecasts fall short
month after month, quarter after quarter, and year after year. It's why so many forecasts
are stuffed with nonsense just to get to a number. If you (or your organization) are
regularly missing forecasts, it's time to take a different approach and forecast on win
probability.

Fanatical Prospecting
Ultra-high performers are fanatical prospectors.1 Developing and maintaining a fanatical
prospecting mind-set is the first and most important key to ultra-high sales performance.
Because ultra-high performers are fanatical prospectors, they can be picky. They have
far more opportunities to choose from than the average salesperson. They have the
luxury of spending their limited and precious time on the most qualified deals with the
highest win probabilities.
To avoid putting themselves in a situation where desperation from an empty pipeline
causes them to engage in questionable, low-probability, or low-value deals, UHPs make
prospecting a daily priority.
Average salespeople spend most of their time at the Feast or Famine Amusement Park
riding the Desperation roller coaster. For average salespeople, prospecting is not a
priority and is random and irregular at best. Typically, they prospect with intensity only
when at rock bottom with an empty pipeline.
It's for this reason average salespeople often find themselves face-to-face with the
Universal Law of Need. This principle governs desperation. It states that the more you
need something, the less likely it is you will get it. When all hope for survival rests on
one, two, or even a handful of accounts, win probability plummets.
Desperation is a disruptive emotion and a sign of low Sales EQ. When you are
desperate, you no longer focus your thoughts on what is required for success. Instead,
you focus on what will happen to you if you fail. The result is lowered self-esteem, lack
of confidence, palpable fear, irrational behavior, and poor decision making.
In this state, stakeholders sense your desperation. They naturally repel salespeople
who are needy, desperate, and pathetic. Instead, they gravitate toward sales
professionals who exude confidence. When you reek of the foul stench of desperation,
people don't buy from you.

The Law of Replacement
UHPs avoid the classic sales roller coaster because they adhere to the Law of
Replacement. The failure to heed this law is the reason average salespeople get on,
and stay on, the Desperation.

Consider this math question:
Becky has 30 prospects in her pipeline. Her closing percentage is 10 percent. She
closes one deal. How many prospects remain in her pipeline?
Most people answer 29.
The correct answer is 20.
So why 20? Becky has a 1 in 10 probability of closing a deal. This means that, on
average, she will close only one deal out of 10 prospects she puts in her pipeline. The
net result is that when she closes one deal, the other nine are no longer viable
prospects. Her pipeline will be reduced by 10 prospects for every one she closes. She
must now replace those 10 prospects to keep her pipeline full.
You may argue that we couldn't possibly know that the other nine prospects are no
longer viable. To do so, however, is missing the point. We are talking about statistical
win probabilities based on Becky's average closing ratio. The stats tell us, over the long
run, that she must replace those prospects to keep her pipeline healthy and full of
qualified opportunities with high win probabilities.
You must be relentless in pushing new opportunities into your pipeline to replace the
prospects that naturally fall out. And you must do so at a rate that matches or exceeds
your closing ratio. This simple formula is one of the keys to improving win probabilities.
To be picky, you need choices, and you will never have choices if you are not
consistently prospecting.
I won't be spending additional time discussing prospecting in this book, but if you would
like to learn more, check out Fanatical Prospecting. It's the most comprehensive guide
ever compiled on prospecting and a perfect companion to Sales EQ.

Disciplined Qualifying
Ultra-high performers are stingy. They invest time only with high-probability prospects.
This requires them to be masters at qualifying and segmenting prospects.
Average salespeople have the tendency to treat every prospect the same. Once they
are invested in a deal, they'll continue to “throw good money after bad” even when there
is a neon sign hanging over the prospect blinking that it's a loser. They become
emotionally attached to deals that will never close.
Ultra-high performers have learned how to manage the damaging disruptive emotion of
attachment. UHPs are disciplined enough to walk away from prospects the moment
they feel the probability of closing the deal moves below an acceptable threshold.
The courage to walk away or detach emotionally from low-probability prospects requires
both a full pipeline and emotional discipline. This discipline derives from a system of
built-in checks and balances designed to create awareness and perspective when
qualifying deals. We're going to take a deeper dive into the frameworks for qualifying
opportunities in later chapters.

Mapping Stakeholders
From simple one-call closes to long-cycle complex deals, irrational human emotions,
motivations, perceptions, and subconscious cognitive biases of stakeholders have the
greatest impact on win probability.
A set of stakeholders will determine the outcome of each opportunity in your pipeline.
Each of these stakeholders plays a role—some major, some minor, but all with the
potential to raise your win probability or lower it.
In small, simple deals stakeholders may take on multiple roles. In large, complex deals
those roles may be specialized and well-defined. In some deals, stakeholder roles will
be transparent, clearly conveyed, and easy to ascertain. In others, the stakeholder map
is opaque.
There are five BASIC stakeholders you'll meet in all but the simplest, one-call-close
deals:


Buyers



Amplifiers



Seekers



Influencers



Coaches

While the average salesperson is myopically asking, “Are you the decision maker?” the
UHP is relentlessly working to identify and map all potential stakeholders to understand
their role in the buying process.
Average salespeople leave fate to chance. UHPs see the bigger picture and understand
the implications of stakeholder blind spots on win probability. From prospecting to
qualifying, from the moment a deal enters their pipeline and all the way to the close, the
UHP seeks to know, influence, neutralize, and leverage stakeholders in the quest to
increase win probability.
It is here that ultra-high performers begin to pull away from average salespeople. Once
they clearly understand the stakeholder map and the personal motivations of each
stakeholder, UHPs leverage a set of repeatable frameworks to shape human emotion
and influence buying decisions.

Aligning the Three Processes of Sales
Ultra-high performers are masters of and execute the sales process playbook like
clockwork. But, while average salespeople are mired in the linear, systematic sales
process, pitching logic, data, features, specs, and facts, UHPs are changing the rules of
the game and shifting the playing field.

From the initial contact with a prospect all the way through to the close, they are
shaping and aligning the three processes of sales to bend the win probability curve in
their favor.
1. Sales process
2. Buying process
3. Decision process
The sales process (how the salesperson advances the deal) and buying process (how
organizations [B2B] or consumers [B2C] vet the deal) are linear, rational steps that
cannot and should not be ignored.
The decision process, in contrast, is individual, emotional, nonlinear, and often
irrational. It is the intuitive process through which each stakeholder makes commitments
of time, emotion, and action. Ultra-high performers understand that the decision process
is where strategy, logic, and human emotions collide.

Sales EQ and Human Influence Frameworks
UHPs never forget that they are dealing with emotional, fallible, irrational human beings.
They work hard to gain a deep understanding of the motivations, desires, needs, wants,
fears, aspirations, and problems of each stakeholder.
In sales, perceiving, interpreting, and reacting to your own emotions and the emotions
of stakeholders are critical capabilities. Sellers must learn to manage their own
disruptive emotions and respond appropriately to the emotions of stakeholders, resident
within the logical, linear, systematic sales and buying processes. This is the true
genesis of competitive differentiation.
Mastery of sales-specific emotional intelligence (Sales EQ) explains why one person
becomes an ultra-high sales performer while another is just average, even though the
intellectual ability and knowledge of the two people are equal.
Ultra-high performers are virtuosos with people. They shift win probabilities in their favor
through perceiving, controlling, managing, and influencing nonconforming, irrational,
human emotions. They possess a toolbox full of influence frameworks along with the
agility to apply them in any situation to improve the probability of getting the outcome
they desire.
Average salespeople look in awe at the performance of ultra-high performers, believing
that UHPs have somehow defied the odds. The truth, though, is UHPs bend the odds in
their favor.

DUAL PROCESS
The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the
same time and still retain the ability to function.
—F. Scott Fitzgerald
One of the great myths of the sales profession is that the sales process is about building
relationships. If you read enough of my work, you'd likely be left with the impression that
I've bought into this myth hook, line, and sinker.
It is true that I write extensively about how crucial it is to build, nurture, and leverage
relationships in sales and account management. But I do not believe, like so many
experts and trainers in my space, that the end game of sales is the relationship.
I believe sales is about making sales.
Don't get me wrong: relationships matter. If you want to close lots of deals and deliver
ultra-high sales performance, you'll need to build relationships with stakeholders.
I just want to be crystal clear that the end game is not the relationship; it's the deal.
Salespeople who forget this basic fact are doomed to mediocrity because they're good
at making friends and bad at moving deals forward through the pipeline.
Reps who fall into this trap are often exceptional at perceiving and responding to the
emotions of others. People like them. They just can't advance deals through the pipeline
because the relationships keep getting in the way.
I'm wary of people who tell me that they want to be in sales because they are a “peopleperson.” I don't find that “people-people” do well in the sales profession over the long
haul, because what they are best at is making friends, not sales. People-people are
unable to regulate their disruptive emotional need to be liked and accepted.
I know what you may be thinking: “But, dude, isn't this a book about emotional
intelligence? Are you not writing about interpersonal relationships and connecting
emotionally with prospects? Why would you say something like this? It seems like the
antithesis of everything you preach and teach!”
I get this and realize the point I'm making is hard to swallow. But the undeniable fact is
that, as a salesperson when you are meeting with prospects, you are there to do deals,
not make friends.
Will you make friends along the way? Of course.
Should you make friends? Absolutely.
Should you focus on building deep relationships with stakeholders? The deeper the
relationship, the higher your win probability.
You just need to remember that the outcome you are seeking is not the relationship. It's
the deal.

Sales EQ Balances the Scales
This does not mean that you should focus solely on the self-centered outcome you
want. Bulldozing your way through sales conversations while ignoring the human and
emotional component inherent in sales leads to disaster. If you show up and throw up,
pitch, manipulate, and turn people off, you will fail.
Sales EQ—sales-specific emotional intelligence—equalizes the investment in
interpersonal relationships and achieving your primary objective of advancing
opportunities through the pipeline. It's a dual process that balances out these two
opposing behaviors.
Dual process is the mental and emotional acuity to at once stand in the stakeholder's
shoes, viewing things from their perspective (empathy) while remaining focused on your
sales objective and targeted next step (outcome).
It's not the zero-sum game of the “people-people”—you are either for your prospects or
against them. Nor is it the cold, calculated approach of the narcissistic manipulators—
focused on extracting as much from prospects as possible, in the shortest amount of
time, with the least amount of emotional investment.
Sales professionals who are adroit at leveraging dual process are masters at managing
their own disruptive emotions. They are empathetic, understanding, and invest in
relationships. Yet, they detach from their egocentric need to be liked for the sake of
achieving their objective and moving to the next step.
This dual process is the foundation of sales specific emotional intelligence.

Four Pillars of Sales-Specific Emotional Intelligence
I believe that emotional intelligence is situational and contextual. It is applied differently
in leadership, in peer-to-peer groups, in the classroom by teachers, on the beat by cops,
in spousal relationships, on the battlefield, or in parenting.
In sales, emotional intelligence is applied in the context of the sales process. Sales EQ
is leveraged to increase win probabilities by shaping and influencing stakeholder
decisions. Ultra-high performers (UHPs) have mastered the four pillars of sales-specific
emotional intelligence:
1. Empathy
2. Self-awareness
3. Self-control
4. Sales drive
For UHPs there is not a binary decision: emotional connection or outcome. It's
relationship, emotional connection, and outcome. Sales professionals who leverage
sales-specific emotional intelligence are able to seamlessly manage emotions and
outcomes without either becoming a zero-sum game.

8
EMPATHY
Truth is, I'll never know all there is to know about you, just as you will never know all
there is to know about me. Humans are by nature too complicated to be understood
fully. So, we can choose either to approach our fellow human beings with suspicion or
to approach them with an open mind, a dash of optimism and a great deal of candor.
—Tom Hanks
“When young couples come into our store to shop for engagement rings, it is a joyous
occasion—part of their journey together. It also has the potential to become a stressful
and embarrassing experience for the young bachelor,” explains Shell, an ultra-highperforming sales professional in the high-end jewelry market.
“The bride-to-be has a fantasy. In it she sees herself showing off a massive ring to
friends gathered around her in awe. The young man is desperately trying to give her
that dream and avoid having to admit that he can't afford the ring.”
Shell points to the massive diamond on her finger. “The girl almost always gravitates to
the $20,000 diamond. The guy's face turns white. You can feel his stress. It's awful
because he's between a rock and a hard place—a no-win situation.”
Shell has developed a huge referral clientele because she's empathetic and does the
right thing for her customers.
When working with couples, she tunes in to their emotions. She's aware that if the guy
is pushed into a corner, there is a high probability that he'll “need to go home and think
about it” and she'll never see him again.
Ultra-high performers (UHPs) believe their primary mission is serving their prospects
and customers. Their default, in sales situations, is other focused. They actively work to
step into the shoes of stakeholders and view things from their perspective—both
rationally and emotionally.
UHPs tune in to the emotions of stakeholders and respond appropriately to those
emotions, often adjusting their own behavioral and communication style so other people
feel comfortable and at ease.
Shell recognizes and relates to the emotions of the young bride and groom. “I always
start the conversation by getting them to talk about their plans after they get married.
Plans for the honeymoon, buying a home, new furniture, kids, and the other decisions
young couples must make as they begin their life together. It's fairly easy to get them
talking because they're in love and excited about this new chapter.”
Shell continues, “Once I know more about them, I recommend a ring that fits into their
lifestyle and won't overburden them with debt. I tell them exactly why I'm making the
recommendation, because I want them to know I'm on their side and want them to get
their marriage off on the right foot.”

Shell explains, “This immediately sets the young man at ease and lowers his stress
level. I take the heat and let him off the hook. At this point he's not walking out of my
door and going anywhere else.
“Then I help the bride feel comfortable by showing her how she can trade her ring in for
a bigger one once she and the love of her life are on solid footing financially. This keeps
her Cinderella dream alive and gives her space to think rationally about this decision.
Once the bride buys in, closing the sale is just a formality.”
Could Shell sell them on a bigger ring? I have no doubt, as she is a gifted influencer.
However, by demonstrating empathy and doing the right thing she both increases the
win probability of the deal she is working and generates referrals and long-term repeat
customers.
She smiles. “Those guys send all of their friends to me.”

The Foundation of Sales EQ
Cognitive intelligence is empty without empathy. In one of my favorite quotes about
empathy, author Dean Koontz explains why IQ alone isn't enough for ultra-high
performance:
Some people think only intellect counts: knowing how to solve problems, knowing how
to get by, knowing how to identify an advantage and seize it. But the functions of
intellect are insufficient without courage, love, friendship, and empathy. 1
Ultra-high sales performance requires intellect and empathy. Both play vital roles in
relationships, communication, and helping people win.
Empathy is the foundational pillar of Sales EQ. It is the beginning and the end. Empathy
is the ability to step into someone else's shoes and experience emotion from their
perspective—to understand and identify with another's feelings and motivations. You
demonstrate empathy for people by identifying with them, emotionally.
Empathy gives insight into the perspectives of others. It helps you see each person as a
unique individual and understand that, regardless of how common a problem may seem
to you, each stakeholder believes his or her problems, opportunities, and situation are
special. It is from this perspective that ultra-high performers bridge to personalized
solutions that validate that they understand that stakeholders view themselves as
unique.

Empathy Scale
We all possess the capability of relating to the emotions of others. 2 For some people this
comes easily, whereas for others tuning in requires intentional effort. My wife, for
example, is highly empathetic. She doesn't need to work hard to feel what other people
are feeling. I, on the other hand, am naturally egocentric. Because of this I must remain
consciously aware of my emotional blind spots and be intentional with my efforts to be
empathetic.

In his dissertation, Personality Characteristics and Superior Sales Performance, Dr.
Marc Hamer makes the case that good salespeople are naturally self-centric rather than
other-focused.3 If you don't have a competitive drive to win, if you are not motivated by
achievement, if you don't have a bigger ego than most people, you're probably not
going to last long in the sales profession.
For this reason, most salespeople, like me, must intentionally focus on developing
empathy and tuning in to the feelings of others.
Empathy begins with self-awareness. In other words, to become effective at tuning in to
the emotions of others, you must first become adept at tuning in to your own emotions
and acknowledging your emotional blind spots.
I know that I'm not naturally gifted with empathy. I am aware that in most situations I'm
going to default to focusing on my own emotional needs before I attend to those of
others. I'm also aware that these traits help me as a salesperson because they allow me
to do difficult things that most people will not—like run headlong into rejection—and hurt
me in relationships.
Each person occupies a unique place on the empathy scale (Figure 8.1). Your natural
gift for empathy is mostly innate—it's baked into your genes. So it's necessary to be
honest with yourself about how you view the world.

Figure 8.1 Empathy Scale
Are you more other-focused like my wife or more self-focused like me? Most people fall
somewhere in the middle of the scale—3s and 4s for the self-centric crowd and 6s and
7s for the other-focused.
One way of knowing where you sit on the empathy scale is to consider how you tend to
interpret the behaviors, communication styles, and emotions of other people. Your snap
judgments about people tell a great deal about how tuned in you are to the emotions of
other people.
There are two general heuristics people employ to interpret behavior:
1. Situational attributions: Upon observing a person who is angry, you
interpret this to mean that he or she is having a bad day or experiencing a
difficult circumstance.
2. Dispositional attributions: Upon observing a person who is angry, you
believe that it is a result of his or her underlying personality and subsequently
label that person as an asshole or a jerk.

People who interpret human behavior based on situational attributions tend to be more
empathetic than those who rely on dispositional attributions and labels.
So, we have a conundrum: people lower on the empathy scale tend to perform better in
sales, yet the ability to tune in to the emotions of stakeholders in the context of the sales
process is a fundamental key to ultra-high performance.

“We need you to help us teach our folks to spend less time on e-mail and more time on
the phone interacting with people,” Patrick, a sales director for a 4-billion-dollar
company, explained. Across his inside sales team of 25 reps there were mostly average
salespeople, a handful of people exceeding their goals, and two ultra-high performers.
The two UHPs weren't just outperforming the group by a little bit. They were crushing it:
the performance of the ultra-high performers was 300 percent better than the average
group. Let that sink in for a moment—300 percent! The curious thing was that no one
knew why.
I spent two days observing the team to learn what was going on. What I discovered
wasn't shocking but it was eye-opening. Patrick's intuition that his people were spending
too much time on e-mail was right on the money.
Almost 80 percent of the communication to prospects and customers from the average
group was via e-mail. They sent e-mail after e-mail, with a few text messages sprinkled
in.
In contrast, almost 90 percent of the outbound communication from the ultra-high
performers was by phone—human to human. Let me disabuse you of the notion that the
UHPs were older—perhaps Gen Xers who grew up using the phone. It's what most
people think when I tell this story. However, one was 23 and the other 26.
Patrick's company does an exceptional job attracting talent and has a meticulous hiring
process with a battery of assessments. The average performers had the same
credentials, same skills, same intelligence, and same training as the ultra-high
performers. Every person on the team was intelligent and talented.

The only real difference between UHPs and the average group was that the UHPs
intentionally sought out and invested in relationships, whereas the average performers
erected barriers between themselves and human interaction.
You must make the conscious decision to become other-focused when interacting with
stakeholders. This begins with developing competence across four core dimensions of
empathy:
1. A desire to understand stakeholders and view things from their perspective
2. Concern about how stakeholders feel
3. A focus on serving stakeholders and solving their problems
4. Deep listening
Deep listening—listening to stakeholders with all your senses (ears, eyes, and intuition)
—opens a window into what your prospects are feeling and helps you tune in to their
emotions.
Empathy comes easily when you intentionally give others your complete attention, turn
off your self-centric thoughts, and become genuinely interested in what they are saying.

Regulating Empathy
Empathy is the most important of all Sales EQ traits. Period. The more empathetic you
are, generally the higher your EQ. But too much empathy can also be a problem.
James came up to me on a break. He was participating in a Fanatical Prospecting
Bootcamp and we'd just finished a short phone block.
“Jeb, you know the hardest part about this for me? If I were in the prospect's shoes I'd
just hang up the phone. I hate when people call me. That's why I can't do this. It just
feels wrong.”
James had been fiddle-farting around, playing with papers and doing anything other
than pick up the phone. Meanwhile the other 25 people in the class had been kicking
ass and taking names.
His empathy was getting in the way, causing him to project his feelings onto other
people. This made it difficult for him to interrupt prospects. He didn't want them to feel
the same way he did when he received a prospecting call; therefore, it was difficult for
him to make calls.
Projecting is a common disruptive emotion for salespeople, especially those who are
higher on the empathy scale.
James and I ate lunch together that day and discussed his feelings. He acknowledged
that if he didn't start interrupting he was not going to be able to keep his job and feed his
family. Since he wanted to do both, James came to the self-centric conclusion that
picking up the phone was in his best interest.

Once that decision was made, we discussed the way prospects would prefer to be
interrupted—we stepped into their shoes. We came to the other-focused conclusion that
those interruptions should be fast, to the point, and relevant so that we would achieve
our objective quickly without wasting their time.
James then deployed the 5-Step Telephone Prospecting Framework from Fanatical
Prospecting because it allowed him to: (1) set the appointments he needed in order to
make his number, keep his job, and feed his family, and (2) be respectful of his
prospects' time.
He went to work and set four quality appointments that afternoon. Once he changed his
mind-set and gained control of his disruptive emotions, he changed his game.
In the right measure, empathy helps you avoid intentionally injuring other people—
physically and emotionally. Empathy regulates greed, hate, jealousy, anger, fear of
scarcity, and a host of other potentially destructive emotions.
Without empathy, we'd have no compunction about steamrollering right over other
people. Hence, extremely low-empathy people, like narcissists and psychopaths, use
hyperempathetic people as doormats or worse.
Yet, in the sales profession, empathy has the potential to become a disruptive emotion
that costs you money, career advancement, and potentially your job. In sales, you must
be empathetic—tuned in to the emotions of buyers and stakeholders—while keeping
your ultimate objective in perspective. This is Dual Process.

2. There are people who are incapable of empathy due to psychological disorders,
brain injuries, or neurological dysfunction. Since these individuals rarely if ever
work in sales, I feel comfortable making this generalization about the sales
profession.

SELF-AWARENESS
You know far less about yourself than you feel you do.
—Daniel Kahneman
Ultra-high performers (UHPs) are not perfect. In fact, they are far from perfect. They
have the same issues, foibles, and hang-ups as everyone else. They have strengths
and weaknesses, blind spots, biases, and unique communication styles that at times
impede their ability to effectively deal with other people.
What sets ultra-high performers apart from average performers is that they are aware of
their shortcomings and blind spots. They:


Accurately interpret their own emotions.



Acknowledge their emotional blind spots.



Are realistic about their strengths and weaknesses.



Understand their preferred communication style and how it impacts other
people.



Have awareness of disruptive emotions and the negative impact these
emotions have on their relationships and performance.

Of course, awareness is easier said than done, especially when it comes to our
shortcomings, emotional blind spots, and weaknesses. Our image of who we are—how
we interact with the world, how others view us, our values, and our judgments about
other people—gets clouded at the subconscious level. Our mind plays tricks on us and
hides reality behind a curtain.
Self-awareness combined with empathy is the key to situational awareness: knowing
when to push and when to pull; when to ask questions and when to bridge to solutions;
when to listen and when to talk; when to be patient and when to ask for what you want.
Situational awareness is one of the meta-skills of sales, especially in the complex sales
environment.

Self-Awareness Is the Mother of High Sales EQ
Developing self-awareness is a difficult and ongoing process. As humans, we are not
naturally adept at looking in the mirror and seeing ourselves for who we really are. 1 The
warm comfort of delusion is much more appealing than the cold truth of reality. But you
cannot be delusional and successful at the same time.
A long line of scientists, behavioral sociologists, and psychologists have delivered
stunning research findings into how our subconscious mind drives our behavior. We all
have blind spots when it comes to our emotions, our strengths and weaknesses, and
how our style and behaviors impact other people—negatively and positively. Our self-

serving bias, a potentially disruptive emotion, serves to protect our fragile ego and selfesteem through a cognitive distortion of reality.
Awareness is the mother of change, growth, development, and improvement. But it's
difficult to change what you can't see. Developing self-awareness is, without a doubt,
the most difficult and challenging hurdle to developing and maintaining a high Sales EQ.
There are six keys to developing self-awareness:
1. Psychometric assessments (such as DISC or Myers-Briggs)
2. Coaching or mentoring
3. Direct feedback
4. Writing down your goals
5. 360-degree review
6. Self-reflection

Psychometric Assessments
We each have a unique way of dealing with the world around us. Some people are
direct whereas others beat around the bush. Some people talk slowly and with little
emotion, while others are more animated. People may be ambitious and driven,
analytical and careful, or social and outgoing.
Self-awareness of your interpersonal style is critical to becoming a more effective
communicator. People feel more comfortable with you when you interact with them
based on who they are—not who you are. This allows you to take advantage of the
similarity bias, a cognitive heuristic that causes humans to like and trust people who are
more like them.
Ultra-high performers are keenly self-aware of their behavioral style, values, and beliefs,
and confident enough to adjust their style to deal with people who are not like them. The
good news is it doesn't take much. Small adjustments in your style often make a big
impact.
There are no good or bad styles—just styles. You are who you are; that is not going to
change. However, when you are aware of your preferred style and how you respond to
specific situations and to other styles, this awareness gives you a powerful advantage in
influencing the behavior of others.
The most direct path to understanding your behavioral style is a personality style
assessment. Assessments, used the right way, can be very effective in helping you
become consciously aware of the impact your preferred communication style has on
others. There are multiple assessment tools, including Myers-Briggs, DISC, Clifton
Strength Finder, Kolbe, and Sales Drive.
We offer a number of assessments to help you better understand your preferred
communication style. Learn more about assessments at

Get a Coach or Mentor
Why do elite professional golfers have swing coaches? Simple. There are millions of
dollars on the line in golf tournaments, and the difference between winning and losing is
often one or two strokes. Little flaws in the pro's swing or mind-set can make a huge
difference in their winnings.
The same is true for salespeople. The people who sign up for my Elite Coaching
Program are often at the very top of their game—ultra-high performers seeking insight
that will help them perform at even higher levels.
You can't change what you can't see. This is the reason so many ultra-high performers
across a range of endeavors have coaches. Coaches hold up a mirror to your behavior
and help you come to grips with the real you.
But let's face it: not everyone can afford to hire a coach. Although I have hired some
amazing coaches, most of the people who coached and mentored me were my
managers and other leaders who took an interest in me. The key to attracting a coach is
being coachable. You must be open to self-development. There are five keys to being
coachable:
1. Ask. Put away your pride, open up, and ask for help.
2. Listen. Check your ego at the door and be ready to stretch. If you are
resisting, defensive, or not committed, coaches quickly disengage and invest
their time and energy elsewhere.
3. Trust. Remember that you have blind spots. Your coach will often point out
things that you cannot see. Give your coach a break and trust that what they
are seeing is real.
4. Take action. Be willing to follow through on agreed-upon action steps. There
is nothing more frustrating for a coach than a coachee who fails to follow
through.
5. Progress. Make progress. If your coach doesn't see you putting what you
learn into practice, then working with you loses its joy.
You'll find additional resources on coaching and my Elite Coaching Program at
https://www.salesgravy.com/saleseq or https://elite.salesgravy.com.

Ask for Feedback
Schedule a meeting and ask your manager to give you feedback on your performance.
Be prepared with specific questions about your strengths and weaknesses, behaviors,
interactions with other people, and communication style, because you may have to
prompt your manager for the specific feedback you want.
Most salespeople don't actively seek out honest feedback, because the truth hurts.
Gaining self-awareness requires courage to face the truth, walk through the pain, and
learn.

Write Down Your Goals and Plans
Investing time to develop a set of goals and writing down your plans can be eyeopening. Going through the process, you gain insight into your values, dreams, desires,
and what is holding you back.
This awareness helps you draw a more accurate picture of yourself. It begins with two
simple questions:
1. What do I want?
2. How badly do I want it?

http://www.FreeGoalSheet.com.

360-Degree Review
Marketers frequently gather current and potential customers into rooms with two-way
mirrors to test perceptions of products, services, and brands. These focus groups help
them understand the emotional and experiential perceptions people have of the brand.
The data gathered is used to refine products, services, messaging, positioning, and
advertising.
Imagine that we've assembled a group of your customers, prospects, peers, and
managers together in a room. Sitting with the group is a moderator who will ask
questions to uncover their perceptions of you.
Behind a two-way mirror are researchers who take notes on every data point: the words
the individuals in the group say, and their expressions, tones of voice, and body
language. You have been invited to sit and observe.


What is their experience interacting with you?



Do they feel you have empathy?



Do they find you likable?



Do they trust you?



Will they say that you care about them?



Do they see you as a good listener?



Do you offer value, or are you focused on taking value?



How do you stack up against your competitors? Are you perceived as
different or the same?



What would they say you should change or refine to become a more
impactful sales professional?



What do they perceive as your strengths?



Overall, what is their perception of you as a person?

For most people, this exercise would be an excruciating emotional experience. Few
people would enjoy the criticism, no matter how constructive.
Ten years ago, I hired a firm to do a 360-degree assessment of me. After reviewing the
report, I was crushed. Though my focus group had positive things to say about me, they
also had many negative observations. It was painful to learn how completely blind I was
to behaviors that were holding me back in relationships with the people I counted on
most.
This painful and eye-opening 360-degree process was a turning point. I emerged from
that crucible acknowledging that the value of my education, skills, talents, and
accomplishments paled in comparison to the quality of my interpersonal skills. I learned
that I had to stand in the shoes of others, respond appropriately, and perceive the world
from their point of view. I learned the real value of self-awareness versus delusion.
A 360-degree review can be expensive. It is also one of the most powerful ways to kickstart self-awareness. Many employers will provide one for you. Ask your manager or
your human resources (HR) organization about starting the process. If you have the
resources I highly recommend paying for it yourself. Learn more about 360-degree
reviews at https://www.salesgravy.com/saleseq.

Self-Reflection
Last spring, my parents prepared their garden for pumpkins. They turned the soil,
fertilized, planted the seeds, and watered. Then they went on vacation for two weeks.
Upon their return my father went straight out to the garden, eager to see if his pumpkin
vines had sprouted. He was thrilled to find that things were indeed growing.
Knowing that he had to pull weeds, that had also sprouted, to keep them from choking
out his crop of pumpkins, he got down to work. But he quickly realized that he could not
tell the weeds from the good plants. I advised him, tongue in cheek, of the old saying
that “a good plant will be easy to pull from the ground while the weed will be difficult.”
My mom wasn't thrilled about having him experiment with the tensile strength of the
plants. So, we looked on Google to see if we could find help identifying the weeds. I
typed in “identifying weeds” and got 600,000 results.
It turns out that this is something lots of people are interested in, and for good reason.
By pulling the weeds early, you ensure that the good plants don't have to compete for
nutrition, space, or water and will grow into healthy, mature pumpkins. But waiting until
the weeds can be easily distinguished from the good plants gives the weeds time to
gain a good grip on the soil and choke out the pumpkin vines.
Just as in any garden, weeds are inevitable in life, and frankly just evidence of our
fallibility as humans: weeds of fear, poor attitude, bitterness, laziness, indecision,
ignorance, arrogance, insecurity, self-doubt, clutter, poor time management, failure to
set goals, lack of exercise, poor eating habits, and neglected relationships. How often
do we allow them to grow unchecked until we lose awareness that they're even there?

Weeds start out small. A simple lapse in self-discipline, poor judgment, or
procrastination provides fertile ground for weeds to grow. At first we don't notice a weed
has popped up, but, a little bit every day, it grows and becomes habitual; and by the
time the weed is easily identifiable it is too late—the damage has been done. Our
physical and emotional well-being are choked. Our relationships suffer. Our careers
falter. Failure takes the place of success.
This happens to salespeople, for example, when they put off prospecting and activity,
only to find a month or two down the road that they are producing no business because
their pipeline is empty. It happens when salespeople begin taking shortcuts in the sales
process because they've allowed the weeds of cynicism, arrogance, entitlement, or selfdoubt to take hold.
While no one is perfect enough to keep weeds from sprouting, we can take measures to
identify and pull our weeds before they take hold. One of the most effective ways is
through honest introspection.
Bill George, a professor of management at Harvard Business School, suggests that
“you should develop a daily practice of setting aside at least twenty minutes to reflect on
your life.”2 For many people this quiet time involves exercise, meditation, or prayer.
Silence gives you the space and freedom to just think and contemplate without intrusion
from the outside world. This means scheduling time to:


Sit in silence and just think.



Listen to your inner voice.



Heed your intuition.



Take stock of where you are and where you are going.



Become aware of what's holding you back.

Shakespeare's famous line from Hamlet, “to thine own self be true,” is important to
remember in your quest for self-awareness. We all have the capacity to see who we
truly are and change. It's a simple equation of seeking out the truth, the courage to
endure the pain of that truth, and the desire to use the truth for change.

SALES DRIVE
Desire is the starting point of all achievement, not a hope, not a wish, but a keen
pulsating desire which transcends everything.
—Napoleon Hill
This is the brutal, undeniable truth: sales is a tough, grueling, and at times
heartbreaking profession. The pressure to deliver and the demand to perform are
unrelenting. You must deliver results and keep delivering. Your income and ability to
provide for yourself and your family depend on it.
In sales, unlike most other professions, the threat of losing your job because you have a
bad month, quarter, or year is always hanging over your head. Even when you have a
good month, you can't celebrate for too long because it's not about what you have sold;
it is about what you sell today. On this journey, there are incredible emotional highs and
deep lows.
Despite this highly stressful, high-pressure environment, ultra-high performers (UHPs)
have a relaxed confidence. They fully expect to succeed. They believe they control their
future. UHPs display optimism in the face of adversity.
Dr. Chris Croner spent years researching and has written extensively about UHPs.
Through his research, he has discovered that ultra-high performers “always share one
critical psychological trait, and that characteristic is drive.” 1
Sales Drive is a fundamental component of Sales EQ and includes:
Optimism: The positive feeling of optimism helps you face adversity and keep going.
Optimism is the mother of perseverance. It powers a positive belief system and attracts
positive energy. As Helen Keller so aptly said, “Optimism is faith that leads to
achievement.”
Competitiveness: Do you hate to lose or love to win? The drive to avoid losing is what
keeps UHPs working longer and harder, and doing whatever it takes to win.
Competitiveness is the mother of persistence.
Need for achievement: Psychologist and researcher Henry Murray defined the need
for achievement as “intense, prolonged and repeated efforts to accomplish something
difficult. To work with singleness of purpose toward a high and distant goal. To have the
determination to win.”2 The need for achievement is the mother of self-motivation. 3
Salespeople with a high need for achievement are biased toward action—a critical
competence for getting regular next-step commitments from stakeholders and moving
deals through the pipeline.
We know that a bias toward self-development is an important part of developing a high
Sales EQ and a high AQ. What research4 tells us, though, is it takes more than selfdevelopment to perform at peak performance day in and day out. All good salespeople

train hard and work hard. That is a given. Ultra-high performers, however, gain their
competitive edge from an unquenchable drive.
Dr. Croner is not alone in his findings. Data from multiple research studies tell us that
Sales Drive is more important than talent, experience, education, skills, or technique.
Sales Drive is why salespeople5 with high Sales EQ thrive under pressure while others
with the same level of talent fold up like a cheap lawn chair as soon as things get
difficult.

Developing Drive
What does it take to develop and maintain Sales Drive? How do you incubate optimism,
competitiveness, and need for achievement?
The answer to these questions is twofold. First, there is a component of Sales Drive that
is innate. Like most aspects of human behavior, some of your drive is baked into your
DNA. But like all Sales EQ traits, drive can be developed and honed. You can shift your
mind-set.
This mind-set shift begins with the discipline to develop an internal locus on control and
a clear understanding that there are only three things you can control:
1. Actions—what you choose to do each day and every moment
2. Reactions—how you respond to people, circumstances, and disruptive
emotions
3. Mind-set—your attitude and beliefs
Essentially you must become aware of the disruptive emotions and negative self-talk
that can consume you and take complete responsibility for your success or failure.
Yes, some people are more competitive, more optimistic, and more focused on
achievement than others. Ultimately, however, Sales Drive is a choice that begins with
two beliefs:
1. An expectation that you are supposed to and will win
2. A belief that everything happens for a reason
The expectation that you are going to win is the genesis of optimism, enthusiasm, and
confidence. When you believe you are going to win, it turns out that you'll win far more
often than the person who expects to lose. You'll brush off the disruptive emotions of
doubt and insecurity and ask confidently for what you want, achieve your sales call
objectives more often, get more micro-commitments, and close more deals.
When you believe that everything happens for a reason, your perspective on potentially
negative events will be optimistic. Instead of complaining, “Why me?” when you face a
setback, you ask, “How can I learn from this?” This belief is the cradle of optimism.

When you choose to believe that you are in control of your own destiny, you no longer
fear failure and rejection, because you believe that failure is the path to learning,
growth, and improved performance.
So, here we are, full circle: to maintain sales drive you need self-awareness and you
must leverage that self-awareness for the self-control required to manage the disruptive
emotions that erode drive. The following strategies will help you maintain high drive.

Choose Your Friends Carefully
Misery loves company, and it wants you on its team. If you hang out with people who
have poor attitudes, they'll destroy yours. Instead, spend time with people who build
your attitude up rather than tear it down.

Change Your Self-Talk
There is a little voice inside of you and it jabbers away 24/7. Self-talk, what you say to
yourself internally, manifests itself in your outward attitude and actions. Stop and listen
to what you are telling yourself. If you are drowning in self-pity, blaming the world for
your problems, and telling yourself what you can't do, then it is time to change your
language. You cannot afford the luxury of a negative thought.

Change Your Input
What you put into your brain impacts drive. Reading, watching, or listening to negative
things will impact your attitude. Take a break from the news. Turn off talk radio. Start
feeding positive messages to your brain, and your attitude will gain altitude.

Change Your Focus
Yes, you lost. You had a setback. You failed. When confronted with failure, average
salespeople waste their energy and time dwelling on it. They play the tape over and
over again in their head. Change your view. Embrace the gift of failure. Leverage that
hurt to become stronger and more agile. Harness the energy you are wasting playing
the defeat tape, and use it to drive you toward your next goal.
You are not defined by what happens to you but rather by how you deal with what
happens to you. Each time you face adversity or when things don't go your way, you
have a choice. You can either choose to whine and complain, or choose to learn and
grow.

Physical Fitness
When you face emotional hurdles, Sales Drive allows you to leap over them. But drive
requires a tremendous amount of mental energy.
Mental energy will always be limited by your physical resilience. If you are tired, hungry,
or feel physically drained, it becomes very difficult remain driven and manage disruptive
emotions.

Keeping yourself in great physical condition improves creative thinking, mental clarity,
and optimism. It makes you more nimble and adaptive, and helps you gain the discipline
to maintain emotional self-control. It also boosts your confidence and enthusiasm—the
two most important emotions in sales.
Sales professionals spend an inordinate amount of time sitting and staring at screens.
With the increase in inside sales roles and the advancement of technology like video
calls, e-mail, and social media, salespeople spend less time on their feet than ever
before.
There is mounting evidence that sitting all day is extremely hazardless to your health 6
and impacts your mental capacity. It turns out that when you sit too long staring at a
computer screen, “everything slows, including brain function.” 7
Thirty minutes to an hour a day of exercise keeps you healthy, reduces the chance of
disease, and develops physical resilience.8 Go to the gym, take a walk at lunch, or ride
your bike when you get home at night. Supplement this with 50 sit-ups and 50 pushups. On the weekends, play sports or go for a hike. Carry your bag on the golf course
instead of riding in a cart. Park at the back of the parking lot, walk the stairs, and walk to
the next terminal at the airport rather than taking the train. Work in your garden.
Stand up while you are on the phone and walk on your breaks or between meetings
rather than sitting in the break room or in a conference room gossiping. When you work
out regularly, you'll feel and look more confident and gain control of your emotions.

Get Enough Sleep
Arianna Huffington, the cofounder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post, is on a
mission to help people get more sleep. According to Huffington, “We are in the midst of
a sleep deprivation crisis. Only by renewing our relationship with sleep can we take
back control of our lives.”9
Nothing impacts your health and mental well-being more than sleep. When you get
plenty of sleep, your physical and mental energy is at a peak state. You are more
creative, more disciplined, and more agile. You are more confident, able to think on your
feet, apt to push past adversity, and in control of your emotions; and frankly, you look
and feel better.
Humans need between seven and nine hours of sleep every night for optimal
performance. In today's society, though, it has become a badge of honor to live on little
sleep.
There are all sorts of ugly things that happen to you when you are not getting enough
sleep.10 Over the long term, you become more susceptible to immune deficiencies,
obesity, heart disease, and mood disorders, and your life expectancy is reduced.
In the short term, sleep deprivation has a profound impact on your cognitive ability and
degrades your emotional intelligence. You're grumpy, mentally unfocused, and stressed
out; your memory fails you; and you become susceptible to breaks in emotional

discipline. It is very, very difficult to regulate disruptive emotions, respond appropriately
to the emotions of others, and maintain drive when you are not getting enough sleep. 11

Eat Healthily
In sales, it can be difficult to eat well. Field salespeople swing into fast-food joints to fuel
up, and inside salespeople reach for the bag of chips or candy bar hidden in their desk
drawer and wash it all down with sugar-laden sodas and energy drinks.
Eating poorly is like putting low-grade gasoline in a high-performance race car. To gain
the mental toughness and resiliency to work at your peak throughout the sales day, you
need to fill up with high-test rocket fuel.
Healthy eating is a conscious choice. It is also a commitment that is easy to break when
you are not getting enough sleep or exercise. These days, even fast-food restaurants
have healthy choices. With just a little discipline and planning, you can find nutritious
food on the road, and you can certainly prepare healthy meals at home.
There is one cardinal rule for salespeople and food. No matter what, eat breakfast.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the sales day. It kick-starts Sales Drive.

Develop Mental Toughness
To bounce back from setbacks, to get up after you've been knocked down, and to be
resilient in the face of rejection, adversity, and failure, you need to be mentally tough.
Mental toughness is the ability to accept pain and sacrifice today for a win in the future.
It's the ability to block out negative self-talk, manage disruptive emotions, ignore people
who tell you what you can't do, and put singular focus on a desired goal.
Groundbreaking studies like Angela Duckworth's Grit: The Power of Passion and
Perseverance (Scribner, 2016) are helping us understand just how much mental
toughness matters in achievement. James Loehr, the father of the “psychology of
winning,” described seven core dimensions of mental toughness: 12
1. Self-confidence
2. Attention control
3. Minimizing negative energy
4. Increasing positive energy
5. Maintaining motivation levels
6. Attitude control
7. Visual and imagery control
Each of the dimensions may be learned, practiced, developed, and honed. The key is
making the choice to change your mind-set. Most average salespeople have everything
they need to succeed except mental toughness.

UHPs sacrifice short-term pleasure for long-term gain. They hit the same walls and face
the same emotional suffering as everyone else. What makes them different is their
ability to lean into their challenges, maintain their focus, and control the disruptive
emotions that could derail them from their mission.
In sales, success is paid for in advance. The fact is, sales is a grind. But you've got to
grind to shine. Ultra-high performers are willing to pay the price for success.

SELF-CONTROL
Life is ten percent what you experience and ninety percent how you respond to it.
—Dorothy M. Neddermeyer
Sam Scharaga stared into the trashcan next to his prospect's desk. Stunned. What had
been a routine sales call on a fleet manager, to discuss damaged windshields on fleet
vehicles, had turned ugly in a split second.
The fleet manager already had a relationship with another glass company and, even
though Sam had made a good case for his company, the prospect was unmoved. Sam
thanked him for his time, left his business card “just in case things changed,” and
prepared to leave. He also handed the fleet manager a few logoed sticky note pads.
“Most people like getting our note pads,” explains Sam's son Bob, now the CEO of All
Star Glass, which has grown to 31 locations in California, Nevada, and Texas. “But this
guy grabs the pads from my dad's hand and slams them into the trash can.”
Bob recalls, “This was back when we had one store and my dad was hustling just to
keep the lights on. He was working 24/7. The business was his passion.
“My dad had a hell of a temper, but he just looks at the guy and says, ‘I admire your
loyalty. I wish all my customers were as loyal as you. Those guys are lucky to have you
as a customer.’
“The fleet manager didn't know what to say. By keeping his cool my dad caught him
completely off guard. The guy ended up apologizing, and we eventually earned his
business. Instead of losing his temper, my dad kept his cool, and turned the situation
around.”

Managing Disruptive Emotions
In big and small ways, disruptive emotions hold salespeople back from success. The
sales profession is so engulfed in emotion that virtually every mistake, roadblock, or
failure that salespeople experience can be tied directly to disruptive emotions. The list of
disruptive emotions is long and includes, among many others:


Fear



Anger



Uncertainty



Insecurity



Impatience



Attachment



Detachment



Arrogance



Blaming



Delusion

Disruptive emotions manifest themselves in destructive behaviors that fog focus, derail
relationships, cloud situational awareness, and cause irrational decision making,
misjudgments, and overconfidence; and they can lead to paralysis or procrastination
when you're faced with decisions or asking for commitments.
Managing disruptive emotions is the primary meta-skill of sales. The combination of
situational awareness and ability to consistently regulate disruptive emotions is what
puts ultra-high performers (UHPs) on a pedestal high above average salespeople.
The brutal reality is no matter what you sell, whether your process is simple or complex
or the sales cycle short or long, excellence in sales happens when you learn how to
manage your disruptive emotions so that you can influence the emotions of other
people.
We know that the buyer's emotional experience along the buying journey has as much
(or more) impact on their propensity to buy from you as anything else. When
stakeholders become engaged in the buying process and emotionally connected to the
salesperson (or sales team in complex deals), win probability increases significantly.
From prospecting all the way through the sales process, the failure to manage and
control disruptive emotions is the biggest single reason salespeople blow it with
stakeholders. Disruptive emotions unchecked derail your sales conversations, cloud
your judgment, and interfere with all-important situational awareness.
Because the sales process is human. Because buying is human. You and your
stakeholders are each being bombarded with irrational and disruptive emotions. In
emotionally charged sales conversations, everyone is trying to remain in control and
rational to achieve the best possible outcome.
What makes managing and controlling disruptive emotions so difficult is that each
emotion is, essentially, a double-edged sword. At once the emotion can be an asset or
a detriment, depending on the situation, context, and people involved. It's why
situational awareness—the ability to accurately judge where you are in the sales
conversation and the appropriate next move or response—is such a critical element of
Sales EQ.

Genesis of Disruptive Emotions
The paradox of emotions is that at the same time they are your most powerful ally
they're also your greatest enemy.
Shannon felt her face get hot. For the fourth time in less than 15 minutes, Amir
interrupted her presentation to tell her that she was wrong.

Shannon had worked for months to get to this point in the sales process. Discovery and
building the business case had been a complex exercise requiring several trips across
the country to visit the company's various data centers and dozens of interviews with
stakeholders across the enterprise.
A significant investment of time and money from Shannon's engineering team had been
required to develop the solution she was presenting. With a $10 million enterprise
software and consulting agreement on the line, she didn't need this jerk derailing her.
And he was wrong!
From the beginning, Amir, the target company's CIO, was against the idea of making
any change. Even though the CFO had sponsored the project at the behest of the CEO,
Amir passively resisted and pushed back, making it hard for Shannon's team to build
the business case. Now he was openly working against her, interrupting and pushing
her into a corner.
Suddenly Shannon had had enough. She unloaded on Amir and put him in his place,
refuting every fact and figure he'd thrown at her. She knew more about their data
centers than this old-school Luddite who was just protecting his job.
In a tense and awkward five minutes she made her point and lost the deal. As she
finished her presentation, her sponsor, the company CFO, shaken by her outburst, said
a polite thank-you for her hard work and told her that the committee would take
everything into consideration before making a recommendation to the board.
In the rental car on the way back to the airport, she was still fuming. “Can you believe
that guy? How the hell do Peter Principle executives keep their jobs in companies like
this?”
When Edwin, her vice president of sales, pointed out that maybe she had let Amir get
under her skin, she immediately became defensive and fought to justify her position.
Shannon's sales engineer chimed in. He didn't believe Amir's argument was gaining
traction. “Perhaps you should have just allowed him to talk himself in circles.” Shannon
continued to argue that she'd been right to defend her position.
In the meantime, Amir had gone from a naysayer to an outright enemy. He actively
worked to advocate for another vendor and used his leverage with the other members
of the executive team to keep Shannon's company out.
Shannon's inability to control her frustration, anger, and sense of being diminished in
front of other people led her to turn Amir into an enemy. Subsequently, she, her team,
and her company lost the deal.
The human brain is the most incredible biological structure on earth. It is capable of
incredible things, and even now, after more than a hundred years of nonstop research,
scientists are just at the cusp of unlocking its many secrets. Still, we know a great deal
about how the brain works and its myriad complexities.
We know, for example, that despite its almost infinite complexity the brain is tasked with
one very simple responsibility—to keep you safe and alive. Harvard professor and

psychologist Dr. Walter Cannon first coined the term fight-or-flight response to describe
how our brain responds to threats.
This response in one circumstance can save you from certain death, and in another
unleashes a wave of disruptive emotions capable of destroying a relationship.
Essentially, fight or flight is your autonomic, instinctive response to either stand your
ground and fight or run away when your brain perceives a threat. For humans, these
threats come in two forms:
1. Physical—a threat to your safety or the safety of someone close to you
2. Social—a threat to your social standing: rejection, banishment from the
group, looking bad in front of other people, nonacceptance, diminishment
Since sales is not a dangerous profession, virtually all perceived threats are to our
social standing and fragile egos. It's not a stretch to conclude that 80 percent or more of
the disruptive emotions we face as we walk through our sales day are triggered by the
fight-or-flight response.
The remainder are caused by cognitive biases. At times these mental shortcuts that
allow our brains to think fast in a complex world become disruptive emotions that
impede objectivity.
One point I want to make about both the fight-or-flight response and cognitive biases is
that these disruptive emotions are universal to humans. Therefore, understanding your
own disruptive emotions has the additional purpose of helping you gain empathy for
stakeholders and their irrational behavior. This insight combined with emotional control
is a key to mastering influence frameworks.

Fight or Flight
The fight-or-flight response is insidious because it is a neurophysiological response that
circumvents rational thought and can, at least in the short term, extinguish your ability to
think and focus. It begins in the amygdala and then radiates as hormones are produced
and pumped throughout your entire body.
The amygdala interprets the threat from sensory input. This triggers a release of
neurochemicals, including adrenaline, testosterone, and cortisol. Oxygen- and glucoserich blood floods from nonessential parts of your body into your muscles. Your heart
rate accelerates, your skin flushes, your pupils dilate, you lose peripheral vision, your
stomach tightens, blood vessels constrict, digestion slows down, and you begin
shaking.
This is the root cause of the uncomfortable and often painful physical response to fear,
anxiety, and stress. Oh, and it gets worse: you have zero control over this response.
The fight-or-flight response happens without your consent.
If your response is to fight, like Shannon from our previous story, anger may rage out of
control and you verbally attack a stakeholder. In a milder, and more common, response

you may cut the other person off to argue your point—thus diminishing their significance
and potentially triggering their own fight-or-flight response, resulting in an argument.
Should your response be to flee, you fold in the face of potential or real rejection. You
may become passive and nonassertive when asking for commitments or insecure and
weak when meeting other people.
To prepare your body to defend itself, blood rushes from nonessential parts of your
body to your muscles. One of those nonessential areas from which blood is drawn is
your neocortex—your rational brain. When dealing with threats and trying to stay alive,
thinking through your options is not an asset. You need to move quickly.
As blood drains from your neocortex, you gain the cognitive capacity of a drunk
monkey. In the clutches of fight or flight, you can't think, you struggle for words, and you
feel out of control. Your mind reels, palms sweat, stomach tightens, and muscles
become tense. In this state, without rational intervention, you are consumed by
disruptive emotions and lose control.

Fear
In sales, the most obvious and insidious disruptive emotion is fear. Fear is the root of so
much failure in sales. It holds you back from asking for what you want, prospecting,
getting through the doors of C-level prospects, being assertive, getting to the next step,
and walking away from bad deals; it clouds objectivity and breeds insecurity.

Insecurity
Insecurity drowns confidence and enthusiasm (passion). If we were to strip sales down
to its rawest level, we'd learn that sales is simply one person transferring emotions to
another person. This transference goes back and forth from the salesperson to the
stakeholder and the stakeholder to the salesperson. When you feel and act confident
and enthusiastic, the probability that your stakeholder will be fully engaged and comply
with requests you make goes up exponentially.

Desperation
Desperation is a disruptive emotion that causes you to feel insecure, make poor
decisions, and become needy and weak. It makes you unattractive to other people. You
become emotional and act illogically, which causes you to make poor decisions.
When you are desperate, rather than focusing your thoughts on what is required for
success, you focus on what will happen to you if you fail. Instead of believing you will
win, you assume you will lose, thereby attracting failure.
Stakeholders can sense desperation and are repelled by it. Through your actions, tone
of voice, words, and body language, you send the message that you are desperate and
weak. Stakeholders gravitate toward confidence.

Need for Significance
The most insatiable human need is the need to feel important or significant. This
egocentric need can become one of your most disruptive emotions when left
unchecked. Your need to feel important can cause you to be so focused on yourself that
you pitch and pontificate, talk over other people, fail to listen, and arrogantly talk about
yourself. These behaviors destroy emotional connections with stakeholders.

Attachment
The dark side of competitiveness is attachment. This disruptive emotion causes you to
become so attached to winning, getting what you want, looking good in front of others,
wanting everyone to agree with you, and always being right that you lose perspective
and objectivity. Attachment is the enemy of self-awareness and the mother of delusion.

Worry
Mark Twain once said, “I've experienced many terrible things in my life, a few of which
actually happened.” The downside of your brain's vigilant crusade to keep you safe and
alive is its tendency to focus on the negative—what could go wrong, rather than what
could go right.
From a purely evolutionary point of view this made sense because those who avoided
danger in the first place were more likely to perpetuate their genes. But there is a big
difference between avoiding something that might kill you and a social threat.
The amygdala, though, treats all threats the same. So, we worry and ruminate and play
worst-case scenarios over and over in our heads.
Worry itself can trigger the fight-or-flight response and the stream of disruptive emotions
that come with it. It can lead to the Three Ps 1—procrastination, perfectionism, and
paralysis—disruptive emotions that hold you back in prospecting and sales.
Worrying about events that have not yet happened plagues salespeople. As you roll
through the scenario in your head and see yourself failing, embarrassed, or rejected,
you let the air out of confidence, create insecurity where it didn't previously exist, or
even avoid the situation altogether.

Cognitive Biases
There is nothing you do, no decision, no conversation, no situation where cognitive
biases are not in play.2 Biases are the dark side of cognitive heuristics—the mental
shortcuts that enable quick and efficient decisions and judgments about people and
situations.
But these hasty judgments can cloud objectivity and result in deviation from objectivity
into delusion, causing you to:3


Ignore opportunities, options, and helpful information.



Over- or underestimate win probabilities.



Lose your empathy and disconnect from emotional awareness.



Become blind to the motivations of stakeholders.



Seek out information that supports your point of view while discounting data
that does not.

Cognitive biases emanate from the subconscious and are often triggered before you are
consciously aware of how your decisions and thought patterns have been negatively
impacted. It is very difficult to control them.
The key to control is an intellectual understanding of common cognitive biases and the
self-awareness to catch and redirect them as they occur.

Fundamental Attribution Error
Fundamental attribution error, sometimes called correspondence bias, causes you to
label the behavior of other people based on perceived internal characteristics or flaws
versus external factors. Instead of assuming positive intent when attributing 4 reasons for
another person's behavior, you think the worst of other people. 5

Self-Serving Bias
The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute positive events to your own character
but attribute negative events to external factors. 6 Essentially, the self-serving bias is a
disruptive emotion that prevents you from owning and being accountable for actions that
may negatively impact your egocentric belief system and self-esteem.

Self-Enhancement Bias
Humans have a basic desire and motivation to see themselves in a positive light and
preserve self-esteem. Therefore, we tend to seek out evidence that supports our view of
ourselves.
This can be a positive emotion in situations where we've been rejected or hit a
roadblock, because it helps us reframe our self-talk, see ourselves in a positive light,
and get back up.
The self-enhancement bias becomes destructive when it inhibits self-awareness 7 and
blinds us to our faults and weaknesses, reducing our drive for self-development and
growth; or causes us to avoid coaching and feedback when it might reveal a truth we
are afraid of facing.

Optimism Bias
We learned earlier that optimism is a core component of Sales Drive. The dark side of
optimism8 is that it can cause you to believe that you are less likely to experience a
negative event—like losing a deal—than other people (sometimes referred to as
comparative optimism9). The optimism bias can lead to delusion and blind you to
potential pitfalls with buyers, stakeholders, deals, and competitors, leaving you exposed
to surprises.

Overconfidence Effect
The key to ultra-high sales performance is an obsessive focus on win probabilities. This
requires you to accurately estimate and forecast the potential of opportunities in your
pipeline. The problem is that humans, including you, have the uncanny habit of
systematically overestimating probability.
You've been there before. You've observed someone complete a difficult or complex
task with ease and you've confidently declared, “I can do that!” It's only in the middle of
doing it that you realize you've overestimated your abilities.
Likewise, overconfidence can cause you to invest time on low-probability prospects or
fail to properly plan for sales meetings.
Overconfidence has three dimensions: overestimation of one's actual performance,
overplacement of one's performance relative to others, and overprecision in expressing
unwarranted certainty in the accuracy of one's beliefs. 10

False Consensus and Confirmation Biases
Take a short spin on Facebook and you'll get up front and personal with the false
consensus bias. This disruptive emotion leads you to believe that your values, beliefs,
opinions, and habits are normal and therefore naturally shared by everyone else. 11 If
people do not believe the same as you, they're labeled as abnormal or defective.
The false consensus bias can be extremely damaging in sales.


It impedes empathy and causes you to project your beliefs on other people.



When you assume that stakeholders are on the same page with you, you ask
fewer questions and become less curious.



Stakeholders who do not share your views are considered flawed and you
tend to talk at them and pitch in the attempt to argue them into believing that
they are wrong.

Salespeople whose objectivity is clouded by this bias are often surprised when
stakeholders don't buy. Instead of looking inward for where they may have failed, they
blame the stakeholder or label them stupid.
Humans also have a nasty tendency to form a belief and then seek out information that
supports and confirms that belief while ignoring any evidence that refutes it. This is
called the confirmation bias.
The confirmation bias obscures the truth. You can observe the confirmation bias in full
force at the end of the quarter as salespeople miss forecast, blindsided by deals that did
not close because they ignored contradictory evidence that was staring them in the face
the entire time.

Sunk Cost Fallacy
Most of us believe that we make rational decisions about investments based on our selfinterest and a future state we desire. The truth is, in many cases, these decisions are
influenced more by what we have already invested.
Once we have invested, time, money, and emotion into anything, humans have a bad
habit of throwing good money after bad, believing falsely that they “can't give up now.”
This sunk cost fallacy can cause you to become attached to a low-probability deal once
you've invested time, effort, and emotion into it—even though the evidence is clear that
it will never close. Average salespeople usually have a pipeline full of sunk cost deals.

Developing Self-Control
There is a difference between experiencing emotions and being caught up in them. For
this reason, emotional self-awareness is the mother of self-control. Awareness allows
you, in the midst of your emotional storm, to take control of the helm and change
course.
Regulating and managing disruptive emotions is a difficult and ongoing process. As
soon as you let your guard down, your emotions begin to run amok at your expense—
especially when you are tired, hungry, or stressed out.
We've learned that you have very little control over the process and mechanisms by
which disruptive emotions and cognitive biases originate. For this reason, to gain
control, you'll need to deploy a set of techniques and frameworks that help you become
aware of disruptive emotions, gain rational control, and regulate them before your
emotions create irrevocable damage.
With awareness, you rise above your emotions to become a detached, dispassionate
observer. From this point of view, you gain the perspective and objectivity to assess the
unintended consequences of being swept away by disruptive emotions.

Know Your Emotional Triggers
There are situations, words, types of people, and circumstances in your sales day that
trigger disruptive emotions.12
Some emotional triggers, like getting cut off in traffic or being confronted by a rude
person, occur without your consent. Others, like allowing yourself to walk into potentially
stressful or anxiety-inducing situations when you are tired, hungry, or already
experiencing an overwhelming cognitive load, are self-inflicted.
Many triggers, like facing rejection on prospecting calls, giving presentations, and
dealing with upset customers, are part of the job and unavoidable. Awareness of these
triggers makes it much easier to avoid, plan for, anticipate, or respond to them
appropriately.
Learn to anticipate triggers and become aware of both your physiological and emotional
response leading up to and at the point of the trigger. With awareness, you gain the

control required to consciously regulate the disruptive emotion in the moment, and still
accomplish your objective.

Preparation and Practice
Stressful situations, say an important presentation to a C-level stakeholder while your
manager observes, may trigger disruptive emotions that derail you. Your nervousness
can spill over into insecurity, causing you to look and act as though you lack confidence
or stumble over your presentation.
The most effective way to manage disruptive emotions in these situations is through
advance preparation and practice. Take time up front to prepare yourself by researching
the people involved, anticipating the questions they may ask, stepping into their shoes,
and considering their viewpoint.
Then practice. Roll through the demo or presentation several times in advance or roleplay the sales conversation with your manager or a peer. Play out all the worst-case
scenarios so that you are prepared for any eventuality.
On my team, when we are doing a group presentation, we practice together and talk
openly about where our disruptive emotions might derail us. For example, one of the big
problems with team presentations is the disruptive need to feel important. This
manifests itself when team members jump in and talk over each other, or feel like they
need to make their point after another team member has made a point—one-upping
one another.
We agree in advance who will say what and who will answer which questions. We
practice shutting up, and we develop signals to help each other become aware, in the
moment, when a disruptive emotion is causing our behavior to run amok.
Preparation calms the mind and builds confidence. You'll find that when you take the
time to practice, the actual situation, when you are in it, seems much easier. Your mind
is prepared to anticipate disruptive emotions and rise above them.

Pre-Call Planning
Average salespeople wing it. They leave sales call outcomes to chance and their
emotions drifting in the wind. Ultra-high performers plan for sales calls in advance by
asking and answering four questions:
1. What do I know?
2. What do I want to know?
3. What is my call objective?
4. What is my targeted next step?
Pre-call planning allows them to consider multiple scenarios, develop an agenda, build
questions in advance, and determine the commitment for which they'll be asking.

Positive Visualization
We learned earlier that our minds are hardwired to think about the worst. When faced
with an emotionally unpleasant task, we begin creating negative outcomes in our mind
—outcomes that don't exist. Without intervention, these internal narratives become selffulfilling prophecies.
For instance, Lisa expects to encounter resistance on a prospecting call. This negative
visualization makes her feel insecure. Lacking confidence, she approaches the call with
trepidation. When the prospect answers, she stumbles over her words, sounding weak
and pathetic. The prospect bulldozes over her. Lisa is shaken and expects she'll get
even more resistance on her next call.
“Because the brain's focus on threat and danger far outperforms the reward capacities
of the brain, it is important to keep a deliberate eye on positive possibilities,” 13 advises
Scott Halford in his book, Activate Your Brain. Had Lisa approached the call with
confidence, her demeanor alone would have reduced resistance and generated a more
positive outcome.
It is for this reason that elite athletes14 and elite salespeople employ visualization to
preprogram the subconscious brain. When you visualize success, you teach your mind
to act in a way that is congruent with actualizing that success. 15
Begin by focusing on your breathing. Slow it down. Then in your mind's eye go step-bystep through each part of the call. Focus on how it feels to be confident. Imagine what
you will say, what you will ask. Visualize yourself succeeding. Repeat this process again
and again until you've trained your mind to manage the disruptive emotions that lead
down the dark path of failure.

Manage Self-Talk
There is an endless and ongoing stream of chatter inside your head, shaping your
emotions and outward actions. The conversation you are having with yourself will either
build your attitude, strengthen your belief system, and generate a winning mind-set or
trigger disruptive emotions that destroy you.
Unlike emotions that are activated without your consent, self-talk is completely within
your control. You make the choice to think positively or negatively. To pick yourself up
or tear yourself down. To see a glass half-full or half-empty. To be aware or delusional.
Sit quietly and listen to the conversation in your head—the words you are using, the
questions you are asking. Then resolve to change those words to support the image of
who you want to be, how you want to act, and how you want to feel. Make an intentional
decision to remain tuned in to your inner voice. When it goes negative, stop and change
the conversation.

Change Your Physiology
Studies on human behavior from virtually every corner of the academic world have
proven time and again that we can change how we feel by changing our physical

posture. In other words, internal emotions may be shaped by your outward physiology.
For example, when you slump your shoulders, lower your chin, and look at the floor—
physical signals of insecurity—you feel less confident.
A change in physical posture not only elicits a change in emotions, 16 but it also triggers a
neurophysiological response.17 For example, we know that the hormones cortisol and
testosterone play a significant role in creating the feeling of confidence. Research by
Amy Cuddy of Harvard University demonstrates that “power posing,” physically standing
in a posture of confidence, even when you don't feel confident, impacts testosterone
and cortisol levels in the brain, influencing confidence. 18
Moms know this. They've have been giving us this same advice for years. Sit up
straight and you'll feel better. Keep your head up. Most inside sales trainers teach
salespeople that putting a smile on their face will transfer that smile to their voice.
Act as though you are enthusiastic, think enthusiastic thoughts, and use enthusiastic
language, and you will begin to feel enthusiastic and eventually become enthusiastic.
Even the simple act of saying “I'm awesome!” when someone asks you how you are
doing can lift your mood and cause you to feel awesome—even if you don't.
We know that when you dress your best, you feel your best. When you put your
shoulders up and chin up, you look and feel confident. Use assertive and assumptive
words, phrases, and voice tone, and you will be more powerful and credible—and more
likely to get a yes when you ask for what you want.

Obstacle Immunity
The noncommissioned officers who had served overseas in combat nodded and
laughed in acknowledgment of the uncomfortable truth. They'd rather take live fire than
make cold calls to 18-year-old recruits.
These military recruiters were struggling to make their mission, but not because they
lacked talent or passion. Rather, interrupting people and dealing with potential rejection
were such daunting emotional obstacles—at least in their minds.
When the military brought me in to speak to the recruiters, those calls felt easy to me. In
my mind, the recruiters were doing the high school kids and their parents a favor: giving
the kids a job, college tuition, and amazing benefits. The soldiers, though, felt fear. They
could only see rejection.
For the soldiers, cold calling recruits in an environment that they could not control and
did not understand created, what felt like, an insurmountable emotional obstacle.
In training, the military had run them through endless live fire drills, conditioning their
minds to become immune to that fear before sending them into war zones. Most people,
placed into a situation where an enemy is shooting at them, might freeze or run,
potentially getting other people killed. These soldiers, however, controlled their natural
fight-or-flight response and raced headlong into dangerous situations.
It was only when I drew the parallel between how they had been trained to overcome
the obstacle of fear in the face of live fire and how they could apply the same

methodology for overcoming their fear of calling 18-year-old recruits that the lights
clicked on.
You must teach your rational brain to tell your emotional brain that the obstacle that
seems so big in the moment is actually quite small. This begins by putting yourself in
position to experience the perceived obstacle and the accompanying emotions again
and again.
Self-control in the face of obstacles is like a muscle. The more you exercise it, the
stronger you get.
Once you begin intentionally facing fears and emotionally uncomfortable situations,
you'll learn to anticipate the anxiety that comes right before the obstacle. You'll begin
shifting your internal self-talk and outward physical reaction to that fear. Soon what once
seemed an insurmountable obstacle becomes routine.

Push Pause
We've established that the initial physiological fight-or-flight response is involuntary. The
adrenaline rushing through your bloodstream occurs without your consent. In this state,
with your body and brain drunk on neurochemicals, it is hard to think and keep your
composure.
But adrenaline is short-lived. The fight-or-flight response is only meant to get you out of
trouble long enough to allow you to consider, rationally, your options and next move.
The secret to gaining control of disruptive emotions in the moment is simply giving your
rational brain (neocortex) a chance to catch up and take control.
In her book Emotional Alchemy, Tara Bennett-Goleman calls this the “magic quarter
second”19 that allows you to keep the disruptive emotions you feel from becoming
emotional reactions you express.
In fast-moving situations, to effectively deal with disruptive emotions you need only a
millisecond for your logical brain to wake up and tell the amygdala to stand down. This
allows you to regain your poise and your control of the conversation.
The most effective means of giving yourself this moment is simply to pause before you
speak. When you feel emotions taking over, slow your breathing and count to five. This
simple pause allows time for adrenaline to dissipate and your rational brain to catch up
and hold you back from rushing headlong onto the emotional roller-coaster.
In this brief pause you consider the unintended consequences of a potential response
and instead focus on the outcome you really want.
Another strategy I use is called a ledge. It works well when facing a difficult question, an
objection, or a direct challenge from a stakeholder. The ledge has the same effect as a
pause—giving your rational brain the magic quarter second to catch up and take over.
Instead of stumbling through a nonsensical answer—coming off as defensive, weak, or
unknowledgeable—or arguing, simply ledge with another question:


“That's interesting—can you tell me why this is important to you?”



“How so?”



“Would you tell me more?



“Interesting—could you walk me through that?”



“Just to be sure I understand your question, could you elaborate a little
more?”

The question keeps your stakeholder talking, giving you time to think and gain control of
your emotions.

Focus on What You Really Want
“This damn unit is a lemon. I want a new one and I want it today!” Wayne's customer
was screaming at him on the phone. It was July and the air conditioner his company
had installed three months earlier was broken again. It was the third time, and his
customer was livid.
Wayne, the second-generation owner of the HVAC company, could feel his blood begin
to boil. He didn't like being talked to this way. He was trying to get a word in, but this guy
wasn't even giving him a chance.
“How many units have I bought from you over the last year?” the customer screamed.
Before Wayne could answer, his customer filled in the blank.
“Six. Six units and almost seventy-five thousand dollars. Plus, we have seven more on
order for the renovations we have under way now. You'd think our business would mean
something to you and you'd take this situation seriously!”
Wayne had had enough. How dare this asshole treat him this way! He hated it when
customers threw how much they were spending in his face. He didn't like being trapped.
“If you aren't willing to stand by your equipment, I'm going to pull all of my business and
take it to a competitor. Then I'm going to post it on social media and send a letter to the
Better Business Bureau.” His customer was barely taking a breath between assaults.
Enough! Wayne exploded. His last words ended the conversation: “If you don't like the
way we work, then take your business somewhere else!” When the dust cleared, he'd
lost a customer.
In the moment, it felt good to let this customer, who had crossed the line, have it.
Shortly thereafter, though, there was the headache of responding to the Better Business
Bureau, dealing with the guy's rant on social media, responding to the manufacturer to
whom the customer had lodged a complaint, and explaining to his father how he'd
managed to lose a high-value customer who had been doing business with them for
more than seven years.
In retrospect, he wished he'd kept his mouth shut and listened. Overall, it had been a
good and profitable relationship. The customer was just upset and having a bad day.
But Wayne lost control of his emotions and caused irreparable damage.

During intense conversations, when you are hurt, angry, and frustrated or your ego has
been bruised, you dig in, stand your ground, and argue your point—even when your
point is irrational. Meanwhile, the person on the other side of the argument digs in, too.
In this intractable situation, called psychological reactance, both people argue, neither
being willing to back down. You become attached to winning, to being right. Emotions
escalate and words become personal or biting until something is said that rips the
relationship apart beyond repair. It's human, and it happens every day in person, on the
phone, and via text, e-mail, and social media.
To emerge from these and other emotionally charged situations unscathed, you must
rise above them and avoid responding in kind. Of course, in the heat of the moment this
can be difficult and challenging—just ask Wayne.
There is a technique, though, that when employed will help you maintain your objectivity
and perspective, and help you detach from the need to win the argument. The key is
focusing on what you really want. The technique revolves around a simple question you
ask yourself during the argument:
“Do I want _____ or do I want ___?”
For instance, if you are having an argument with a spouse or family member, you might
ask yourself, “Do I want to be right or do I want to be happy?”
The question that might have helped Wayne avoid losing a valuable customer is: “Do I
want to be right or do I want to keep this customer?”
When you are meeting with a stakeholder who brags on and on about how much he
knows about your product, you want to show him how much you know, too. But, before
you interrupt and talk over him, ask yourself, “Do I want to feel significant or do I want to
get this stakeholder on my side and move to the next step?”
Emotional intelligence expert Daniel Goleman says that this deliberate, top-down
process of putting the rational brain in charge is the key to self-control in emotionally
charged situations.20 It's about thinking about the consequences of acting on your
disruptive emotions and then consciously choosing how you will respond rather than
indulging in the luxury of allowing your emotional brain to run free.

Rise Above Emotion and Choose Your Behaviors
Salespeople who are unable to regulate disruptive emotions get caught up in and
controlled by emotional waves much like a rudderless boat tossed at sea in a violent
storm—pushed from wave to wave, highs and lows at whim.
Ultra-high performers master their emotions. They are adept at being aware that the
emotion is happening, and at leveraging the rational part of their brain to take the helm,
make sense of the emotion, and respond appropriately in the moment. They rise above
their emotions and choose their behaviors.

But let's not sweep under the rug just how difficult it is to appropriately manage
disruptive emotions in the moment. As humans, we have all been that rudderless ship.
We've all said or done things in the moment that later, in retrospect, we regretted.
Platitudes like “You have one mouth and two ears” and “People don't care how much
you know until they know how much you care” are all too common in sales training
rooms. It is easy to talk about managing disruptive emotions in dispassionate clichés
but an entirely different thing to bite your tongue in a sales conversation when
everything inside you wants to blurt out an answer or a solution that seems so logical to
you.
Disruptive emotions are the reason sales methodologies like Challenger, Insight Selling,
SPIN Selling, and Strategic Selling are difficult for average salespeople to actualize
outside of the pages of a book or seminar. Intellect, rational thinking, and process drown
in the sea of disruptive emotions, cognitive biases, and the human subconscious.
The genesis of much of our behavior—good and bad, destructive and effective—begins
outside of the reaches of our conscious minds. We act but are unaware of why we act
unless we choose to tune in and be aware. In sales, you cannot be delusional and
successful at the same time, but delusion is such a gracious thief—a warm, inviting
shelter from the painful truth.
Awareness is the mother of self-control. It is the intentional and deliberate choice to
monitor, evaluate, and modulate your emotions so that your emotional responses to the
people and environment around you are congruent with your intentions and objectives.

SHAPING WIN PROBABILITY BEGINS WITH QUALIFICATION
You don't have to swing hard to hit a home run. If you got the timing, it'll go.
—Yogi Berra
I need to make something very clear. Nothing you learn in this book matters a hill of
beans if you are not dealing with qualified prospects. You can be the greatest influencer
the world has ever known, but if you are dealing with a prospect that is not in the buying
window or stakeholders who are unwilling to engage and make micro-commitments that
advance your deal through the pipeline, you are going to fail. Period, end of story.
For ultra-high performers (UHPs), everything begins with a qualified prospect. UHPs are
super-disciplined at qualifying. They understand that time is money and it is a waste of
time to work with prospects that are not going to buy. They know that qualified
prospects and stakeholders are scarce, and a moment spent with a low-probability
prospect takes them away from their most important task—investing in prospects that
will buy.
Effective qualifying begins with gathering information while prospecting. It continues
during your initial conversations with stakeholders, through discovery, and maintaining
acute awareness throughout the entire sales process for signs that might disqualify or
lower the win probability of your deal.

Chasing Ugly Deals
If you've ever played baseball or softball or watched your kids play, you've no doubt
witnessed a batter chasing a wild pitch—too high, too low, or way outside of the strike
zone. It almost never works out.
Several years back, when my son played Little League baseball, his team was in the
bottom of the sixth inning with two outs and the bases loaded. The game was tied. With
the winning run on third base, all his team needed was a hit to win the game and
advance to the play-offs.
As the next batter walked from the dugout toward the batter's box, the coach pulled him
aside and gave him some sage advice.
“Whatever you do,” Coach Sandro admonished, “don't swing at nothing ugly.”
Average salespeople, driven by the disruptive emotions of desperation, impatience,
sunk cost, or attachment, waste time, energy, and emotion swinging at ugly deals: lowprobability deals that are unprofitable, are unqualified, are not in the buying window,
don't have a budget, don't have engaged stakeholders, or because of contracts or other
constraints don't have the ability to buy.
From the outside looking in, it's obvious that these low-probability, ugly deals will never
close and will divert the salesperson's time and attention from better opportunities. Yet,

despite the obvious signs, average salespeople forge forward, either delusional or
oblivious, placing ugly deals in their pipelines and forecasts, wasting endless hours
working on prospects that will never close.
Sadly, the results are predictable. These salespeople strike out.

Define the Strike Zone
The first step in qualifying is to clearly define the strike zone. Far too many companies
(especially start-ups and small businesses), sales organizations, and sales
professionals fail to develop a profile of an ideal qualified prospect (IQP). This profile is
a composite that includes buying window, compelling buying motivations, stakeholder
hierarchies, engagement, competitor entrenchment, sales cycle, industry vertical,
company size, fit, and more.
Here is a blinding flash of the obvious: if you don't define the strike zone, you will waste
a lot of time chasing ugly deals.
If you work for a large, established company, it's likely that an IQP profile has already
been created. This profile will vary based on account size, market vertical, product, or
service. Spend time with the UHPs on your team as well as your sales leader to ensure
you understand the less tangible nuances of your company's or product line's IQPs.
If you work for a small company or start-up, the IQP may be nonexistent or transforming
rapidly as the organization evolves. You may be left to your own devices to figure it out.
Begin by analyzing your product and service delivery strengths and weaknesses. Look
for patterns and commonalities among your best customers. Define and map common
stakeholder roles. Analyze the deals you are closing, and gain a deeper understanding
of trigger events that opened those buying windows.
Once you have gathered sufficient information, develop a profile of the prospect that is
most likely to do business with you and, over the long term, be a profitable, happy
customer.

Qualifying Methodologies and Shortcuts
Rather than a single decision point at a single place in time, effective qualification is an
ongoing series of decisions beginning with developing effective prospecting lists and
continuing along the entire sales process journey.
Over the years, many qualifying methodologies and shortcuts have been created to help
salespeople quickly assess the viability of a deal. Most have easy-to-remember
acronyms.
My take is that none of them are better or worse than any of the others. Frankly, it's
situational. Depending on the complexity of the deal, length of cycle, product, service,
and so on, you'll need to choose what works best for you, and more than likely you'll
end up with a mashup of the various methodologies.

BANT
The most commonly used early qualification methodology is called BANT:


Budget: Does the prospect have the budget?



Authority: Are you talking to a person with the authority to make a decision?



Need: Does the prospect or the prospect's organization have a need for your
product?



Time line: Is the need urgent? Is there a defined time line for making a
buying decision?

An alternative close cousin to BANT is ANUM, which stands for authority, need,
urgency, and money. While BANT focuses first on available budget, ANUM prioritizes
identifying the decision maker. Both BANT and ANUM qualification methods work well
with:


Short-cycle, low-complexity deals.



Mature products and services for which need can be clearly defined.



High-activity sales roles in which salespeople engage many prospects a day
and thus need to make quick decisions about the viability of those prospects.

BANT and ANUM are deficient when applied to long-cycle, complex deals that carry
high risk for the buyer and have a wide array of stakeholders.

PACT
With emerging or disruptive products and services, there is rarely a planned budget and
little urgency because the prospect wasn't even aware the product or the problem
existed.
In her book, The Sales Development Playbook, inside sales expert Trish Bertuzzi
suggests a more effective strategy for early qualifying when selling disruptive products
called PACT:1


Pain: Not every prospect will have a need for your product or service. The
bigger question is: Do they have a level of pain (known or unknown) that, if
revealed, would cause them to take action to remove or ease that pain?



Authority: Are you able to identify the stakeholders and the level of influence
they have on the deal? Are you stuck at too low a level in the organization?
Are you able to level up?



Consequence: Your prospect may feel pain, but if there is not a big enough
consequence or implication to the prospect or the company for not acting on
this pain, it is unlikely they will change.



Target profile: Does this prospect fit your IQP profile? If not, you're likely
looking at a deal that will never close.

MEDDIC
This methodology was developed by Jack Napoli and Dick Dunkel primarily for longcycle technology sales. However, MEDDIC works well with long-cycle, complex, and
enterprise-level deals in any industry.
When used effectively, it significantly improves pipeline forecasting accuracy because it
forces you to know how your prospect buys, the compelling reason for buying, and who
in the account will drive that decision, before investing additional resources in the deal.


Metrics: Is there quantifiable, provable impact to the organization for
selecting you as the vendor?



Economic buyer: Do you have access to the ultimate decision maker—the
person who has the unique authority to say yes?



Decision criteria: Do you understand the criteria that will be used to select a
vendor? Can you influence the criteria? Can you meet the criteria?



Decision process: Do you understand the decision process and time line?
Can you influence the process? Can you align it with your sales process?



Identifying pain: Is there enough pain or a compelling trigger event
associated with not deploying your product or service to cause the economic
buyer to feel an urgent need to change?



Champion: Do you have sponsors or coaches who advocate for you or
amplify your message?

TAS
MEDDIC combined with the Targeted Account Selling (TAS) qualifying methodology
can be very effective. TAS is a fantastic go/no-go methodology following initial discovery
that forces you to answer four questions:
1. Is there an opportunity?
2. Can we compete?
3. Can we win?
4. Is it worth winning?
All of these are excellent questions to ask at the murder board when assessing the
viability of deals. We'll discuss murder boarding in detail later in this chapter.

WOLFE
When working with contractual sales (especially when those contracts create
exclusivity) or working with a prospect that is already using a competitor vendor, I
leverage the WOLFE qualifying methodology.

Contractual sales are unique. Buying windows are open for a short period of time, are
typically predictable, and the buyer is forced to make one of three decisions: stay with
the current vendor, make a change, or quit using the product or service altogether.


Window: Is the buying window open? If not, how soon will it open? How long
has it been open? In noncontractual, incumbent vendor situations, what
triggered it to open?



Opportunity: What is the opportunity? Is it big or small? Is it long-term or
short-term? Do they have problems, challenges, or opportunities that you are
in a unique position to solve?



Loyalty: How loyal are they to their current vendor? How difficult will it be for
them to change? How much will it cost to change? Are all stakeholders loyal?
Is the current vendor making mistakes you can exploit? Is the current vendor
taking the prospect for granted?



Fit: Is this prospect or problem a good fit for your product or service? Does
their buying process align with your sales process? If not, can you shape
their buying process?



Engagement: Do you have a clear map of the stakeholders who influence
and make decisions? Are you able to access and influence those
stakeholders? If not, what other leverage do you have? Are the most
influential stakeholders willing to engage?

Regardless of the methodology or mashups of methodologies you choose, it's important
to channel your inner UHP and be picky, picky, picky about what you allow to move into
and remain in your pipeline.

Nine-Frame Qualification Matrix
I'm a fan of simple and visual. My favorite way to qualify and continue to qualify
opportunities is with a simple nine-frame qualification matrix. This tool offers a visual
representation of qualification data points across six independent dimensions. I love it
because it integrates with and amplifies any qualification methodology or shortcut.
The matrix can be overkill with short-cycle, low-complexity deals yet extremely eyeopening as complexity grows, making it easy to assess win probability throughout the
cycle.
Earlier this year, for example, while working with a group of sales professionals at one
of the world's premier tech companies, I had them split into teams and on whiteboards
draw this nine-square matrix. The columns were labeled Technical Qualifiers,
Stakeholder Qualifiers, and Fit Qualifiers. The rows were labeled High Potential
Prospect (HPP), Medium Potential Prospect (MPP), and Low Potential Prospect (LPP).
It looked like Figure 12.1.

Figure 12.1
Within each square the participants described the profile of a prospect that would fall
into that square. In the High Potential Prospect/Technical Qualifiers square, for
example, they agreed on:


Greater than $2 billion in annual revenue



CIO headquartered in the United States



Global footprint



Greater than 10 percent annual growth rate



At least one serious data breach in the previous 24 months

This represented the highest-potential prospect for the software product this group was
selling based on only technical qualifiers (TQs). Since TQs are just one part of the
puzzle, we proceeded to complete the remainder of the matrix.
Technical qualifiers. TQs are quantifiable facts and figures. This is the easiest
information to gather prior to engaging a prospect. For example, at Sales Gravy we sell
an online remote training and mobile learning solution. Our target companies are $10
million to $100 million in revenue, privately owned, with greater than 10 sales resources
on the team. These prospects represent our highest potential for self-directed and
instructor-led remote learning sales. As prospects move away from this sweet spot, win
probability decreases.
Stakeholder qualifiers. This column of the qualification matrix is stakeholder and
engagement focused. Stakeholder qualifiers (SQs) help define the roles and the
authority of the people you are dealing with and their level of engagement. For example,
if I'm dealing with an engaged CEO in a complex deal, it's an HPP SQ. On the other

hand, if I'm on the receiving end of a blind request for proposal (RFP), I've got an LPP
SQ.
Much of stakeholder qualification is tied directly to mapping the stakeholder array within
the opportunity. We'll discuss stakeholder mapping in detail in an upcoming chapter,
The Five Stakeholders You Meet in a Deal.
Stakeholder mapping goes beyond the typical focus on identifying the decision maker.
It's a focus on uncovering the various stakeholders who influence the outcome of a deal.
For example, when I'm able to identify and develop a coach, I move my deal up on the
qualification scale.
There is an element of stakeholder qualification, though, that is purely intuitive. Your
ability to sense and test a stakeholder's emotional engagement is a critical component
of stakeholder qualification. This is where Sales EQ comes into play. We'll be taking a
deeper dive into this in the next chapter, Engagement and Micro-Commitments.
Fit qualifiers. Sometimes you don't fit prospects—their expectations, needs,
requirements, demands, buying process, and so on. Sometimes they don't fit you—your
unique products and services, capabilities, culture, values, processes, and so on. Your
job as a sales professional is to acquire customers that are the best overall fit for both
parties. This ensures that your customer gets maximum value, while your organization
earns maximum profit.
Many salespeople pursue deals that are not a good fit. The consequence of these illfated partnerships are unhappy customers who make demands on your business that
you cannot fulfill, ultimately costing you money and, at times, your reputation.
Some fit qualifiers may be discerned before you ever meet with a customer. In most
cases, though, you'll need to spend time in the discovery stage of the sales process to
gain a better understanding of your prospect's current and future requirements,
demands, and expectations.
Another way to analyze fit is a simple fit matrix. This matrix focuses on two dimensions:
1. Ease of working with the customer and stakeholders
2. Profitability of the account

Hard to work with

Easy to work with

High profit

High profit

Hard to work with

Easy to work with

Low profit

Low profit

In my business, I want customers that are easy to work with and highly profitable—HPP
FQs.

We are willing to work with demanding but highly profitable customers, and we'll gladly
work with a limited number of customers that are easy to do business with but generate
lower profits—MPP FQs. Ultimately, we want to stay away from accounts that are hard
to work with and generate low profits—these are LPP FQs.
Average and poor salespeople (especially) tend to engage a large number of hard-towork-with, low-profit prospects, primarily because these prospects are easy to move
into the pipeline (because no one else wants to work with them), and disruptive
emotions of fear and desperation generated by a thin pipeline have clouded the
salesperson's objectivity.

Measure Every Prospect against Your Ideal Qualified Prospect
Profile
Ultra-high performers are obsessed with win probability. They measure every prospect
against the ideal qualified prospect (IQP) profile. When the prospect doesn't fit, UHPs
have the discipline to walk away. They do not allow the disruptive emotions of
attachment, desperation, or sunk costs to cloud their ability to judge win probability.
I am not saying that every deal must fit your IQP profile perfectly to enter your sales
pipeline. This is not how the real world works.
Recently a company selling high-end, cloud-based service delivery software deployed
me to help them improve the pipeline, which was dangerously thin (only 1× expected
quota). I discovered a raging conflict between the business development group and the
account executives (AEs).
The AEs would only engage in opportunities that were perfect (with a capital P). They
were unwilling to work with any prospect that wasn't served up on a silver platter. It was
killing the pipeline.
HPP unicorns are rare. Most opportunities are imperfect. Qualification is as much an art
as it is a science and data never tells the whole story.
You must both consider factual evidence and listen to your intuition when assessing the
viability of a deal. Along the way, based on empirical information combined with gut
instinct, you must make a series of decisions to discern if the opportunity merits your
continued attention (Figures 12.2 to 12.6).

Figure 12.2

Figure 12.3

Figure 12.4

Figure 12.5

Figure 12.6
In some cases, it makes sense to take a risk and swing outside of the strike zone.
However, there is a difference between taking a calculated risk and chasing an ugly
deal out of desperation or delusion.
When you choose delusion over reality, you are making a conscious choice not only to
lie to yourself but to lower your standards and performance. Reality is the realm of the
ultra-high performer, and joining reality is one of the first steps on the road to developing
a pipeline of high-probability deals.

Murder Boarding
Engaging in opportunities that you shouldn't is easy when you're desperate. Letting go
of bad deals after you've made a significant investment of time and emotion is difficult.
Once you've made the investment, the sunk cost fallacy causes you to ignore probability
and invest even more.
Your naturally competitive nature breeds attachment. Optimism and overconfidence
biases obscure objectivity, and you delude yourself into believing that you can close a
deal that no one else could, even on their best day (see “Overconfidence Effect”).
In The Lord of the Rings, Gollum is famous for muttering “my precious” as he clings
desperately to the ring he holds so dear. His emotional attachment to the ring is so
strong that he follows it to his death.
This is an uncanny parallel to how many salespeople hold on to pipeline deals that are
never going to close. Sales managers can practically beat them off these loser deals,

and the salespeople will go back to their “precious” time and time again, as if pulled
there by a powerful force.
UHPs utilize qualification strategies to rise above disruptive emotions and make
objective decisions about how, where, and with whom to spend their time. They also
deploy a system to create awareness when they are wasting time on deals that in early
qualification looked ideal but deep into the sales process have lost their luster.
One of the best sales managers I ever worked for played a game with every big deal in
our pipeline. We'd get in a room and explore each potential scenario that could kill the
deal. This wasn't a broad 30,000-foot conversation. We dove into the minutia and killed
the deal (murder boarding). Nothing was sacred. Every stakeholder, potential pitfall,
competitor, and our own weaknesses were possible villains.
The sessions, usually conducted with several of my peers, were painful and, at times,
embarrassing. Murder boarding exposed blind spots, overconfidence, lack of vigilance,
confirmation biases, weaknesses, and gaps in our knowledge. It was uncomfortable to
be confronted with the fact that you didn't know important information because you had
been too afraid (disruptive emotion) to ask hard questions.
The first time I participated in a murder boarding session I hated it. I didn't see the point
of deflating my confidence (see “Self-Enhancement Bias”). Over time, though, I grew to
love the process because it made me better. I closed many, many deals that would
have been lost if not for the insight I gained from murder boarding.
Objectivity is a big problem for average salespeople. Whereas ultra-high performers
easily jettison prospects that they feel are low probability, the average salesperson
holds on to bad deals and rides them like the Titanic all the way to the bottom of the
abyss.
UHPs have the emotional acuity and discipline to poke holes in their deals—to ask the
hard questions and face the hard truth. They're open to feedback and they leverage the
perspectives and opinions of other people.
Ultra-high performers manage disruptive emotions and get real and strategic about their
pipeline opportunities, allowing logic and objectivity to supersede emotional attachment,
cognitive biases, and delusion.

ENGAGEMENT AND MICRO-COMMITMENTS
Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small steps brought together.
—Vincent Van Gogh
Kurt Long, CEO and founder of the data security firm FairWarning, admits that it was
not the optimal situation to be in. “But I didn't have much of a choice,” he explains. “We
were launching our new cloud-based security product and at that point I was the only
person who really understood it enough to sell it.”
It was a long shot. A new software as a service (SaaS) program no one had ever heard
of. A hungry CEO and founder. A huge targeted prospect. A distance of 4,400 miles
between Tampa and London. Only one relationship inside that big company.
“What I had going for me, though, was Andy, a stakeholder inside the company who'd
taken an interest in the software. He was totally engaged.”
For Kurt, like many ultra-high performers (UHPs), the most important qualifier is
engagement:


Will the person I am working with match my effort?



When I give, does the stakeholder give back?



When I ask for small, reasonable commitments, do they accept or negotiate
an alternative?



When we agree on commitments, do they keep them?



Are they invested in the process?

“Time is my most valuable asset,” Kurt explains. “If my stakeholder does not value my
time as much as they value their own, I'll walk away.”
Kurt tested Andy's engagement by asking for micro-commitments—small steps forward.
Andy agreed to and honored those commitments. He matched Kurt's efforts. “He was
sincere, and his actions made me believe that he was invested in getting our cloud
security implemented. He worked with me to keep the ball moving forward—always
moving to the next step.”
Because he was constantly testing engagement and getting micro-commitments, with
each step win probability increased until eventually the ultimate commitment was a
foregone conclusion. The win gave Kurt the momentum he needed to launch his new
product and build a sales team to take his software to more companies.

Testing Engagement
We learned in the previous chapter that you should be focused on prospects that fall
inside your strike zone—closely matching your ideal qualified prospect (IQP). However,

just because a prospect is in the qualification sweet spot technically, that doesn't mean
that the prospect has a high win probability.
Yes, the prospect may be big, the buying window may be open, there may be a budget,
there may be a good fit, and there may be urgency. Nonetheless, if key stakeholders
and buyers are unwilling to engage, your deal is going nowhere.
Ultra-high performers are constantly testing to ensure that stakeholders are engaged.
Testing engagement serves three purposes:
First, it is a compass that helps you gain objective awareness of reality. This awareness
is crucial to managing disruptive emotions, including attachment, optimism bias, and the
sunk cost fallacy as you assess the win probability of the opportunities in your pipeline.
Second, it helps you gauge the win probability of the deal so you make better strategic
decisions both with your actions and with your time.
Third, the process of gaining micro-commitments increases win probability because
small commitments lead stakeholders to make larger commitments.
Engagement is complex. It is emotional, intangible, individual, and a moving target.
Getting stakeholders engaged, keeping them engaged, and testing and gauging their
level of engagement requires empathy, self-awareness, and self-control—all elements
of Sales EQ.
When UHPs sense that engagement is not there, they step back, reassess strategy,
reengage the stakeholder, or walk away from the deal altogether. There are two ways to
test engagement:
1. Tune in to emotions.
2. Ask for micro-commitments.

Tune In to Emotions
During sales conversations, pay close attention to the emotions of the other person.
Observe how they answer your questions. Are their answers full and elaborate or short
and clipped?
Pay attention to their body language, voice inflection, and eye contact. Listen deeply
and intuitively for emotional cues. Are they hiding emotions and information or being
open, honest, and transparent?
UHPs have their empathy antennae up during sales conversations. They watch and
listen, both objectively and intuitively, for emotional engagement and the progression of
that engagement.
At the outset of initial conversations with stakeholders, there is usually an emotional wall
between you. This is natural. However, over the course of that first conversation and
subsequent conversations the wall should become progressively lower. If it does not or
will not, you must make an honest assessment:



Are you doing something to impede an emotional connection?



Do you need to adjust your communication style?



Is there something you are doing or saying that is causing the person to
distrust you?



Are you talking too much and listening too little?

If your style, behavior, or disruptive emotions are getting in the way, step back and
adjust. In some cases, when you are unable to flex your communication style enough to
get in sync with the stakeholder, it may make sense to get another person to be the
“face” with that stakeholder. I've successfully leveraged this tactic many times in the
past to keep deals moving forward.
If the answer to these questions is no and the stakeholder is still not engaging, then you
have three choices:
Dilute the stakeholder's influence: If it is a complex, long-cycle deal and there is a
wide stakeholder array, you may have the luxury of diluting the unengaged
stakeholder's influence by building emotional connections and alliances with other
players on the team.
Leverage the take-away: If the stakeholder has buying authority or exerts a great deal
of influence on the outcome of the deal, leveraging a take-away may disrupt their
position and pull them toward you.
“I'm sensing that what I'm saying is not connecting with you. The last thing I want to do
is waste your time and my time. Is there something I need to do differently, or should we
just shake hands and go our separate ways?”
(Or a variation of this statement/question appropriate to the unique situation.)
Most salespeople are afraid to challenge a prospect directly like this. “What if I offend
them?” “What if they say they don't want to move forward?” What if, what if, what if—
disruptive emotions of fear, insecurity, and attachment cloud objectivity.
Here is what the UHP knows: if a stakeholder with a high level of influence or buying
authority is not engaging emotionally, win probability plummets. You can choose to
either waste your time on a low-probability deal because you don't value your time
enough to manage your disruptive emotions, or get the truth on the table so you know
where you stand and can make an objective decision about your next move, based on
win probability.
Because people want what they can't have, the most powerful tactic in sales is the takeaway. By detaching emotionally, ending the chase, and being willing to walk away, you
very often disrupt the stakeholder's aloofness and they pull you back in—with the added
benefit of giving you more leverage because the script gets flipped and they begin
chasing you.
Walk away: In some situations, it just makes sense to walk away. If the deal is small or
far outside your IQP, there is no reason to stick around. If you have a full pipeline, deals

that are moving, and little time for games, it's a good time to pick up and go home. If the
stakeholder is beyond unengaged and hostile or rude, your best move is to get on the
phone and find better opportunities.

Micro-Commitments
During each conversation with a stakeholder, ultra-high performers ask for small
commitments. Micro-commitments include the next meeting, access to another
stakeholder, leveling up to the executive suite, data and information, invoices, copies of
contracts, a competitor's collateral, facility tours, breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, or
anything that requires them to agree to and carry through with a commitment.

The Three Commitments
Essentially, there are three commitments we ask stakeholders to make over the course
of the sales and buying process.
Time: The hardest ask in sales is for time. Most people reluctantly give up their time to
meet with you on initial meetings and next steps. When stakeholders are agreeing to
meet with you, it's a good indicator that they are reasonably engaged.
Emotion: We ask stakeholders to answer our questions and reveal their problems,
challenges, and feelings. We ask them to commit emotionally to the solutions we
recommend and to our product and service. We ask them to emotionally connect. When
stakeholders actively participate and lower their emotional wall, it is a sign of
engagement.
Action: We need buyers to provide us with information, make introductions, give us
data, take us on facility tours, engage in trials and demos, sign contracts, give us
money, and implement solutions. When stakeholders are willing to take action and
match your efforts, it's a clear sign of engagement.

Leveraging the Value Bias and Consistency Principle
Ultra-high performers improve win probability by leveraging stakeholder microcommitments to activate the cognitive value bias and human consistency principle.
Humans value that which costs them more. Whether treasure, effort, time, or emotion,
when you pay a high price for something it means more to you. When humans are given
something for free or gain something with little effort, there is little emotional connection
or value assigned to it—regardless of how valuable that thing might be to another
person. It's also why higher value is placed on things that are scarce than those that are
abundant (scarcity effect).
It is also true that humans have a strong subconscious drive to act, behave, and make
decisions consistent with their values and beliefs. To do otherwise triggers painful
cognitive dissonance. Each time a stakeholder makes and follows through on a microcommitment, they must shift their value and belief system to be consistent with that
commitment so as to reduce dissonance.

Micro-commitments are the small steps on the long buying journey. Each step forward
makes the next step easier. Each commitment makes the price paid grow and turning
back more difficult.
With each micro-commitment, time investment, and small effort, stakeholders are
compelled to be consistent with their commitments, feel an increased emotional
connection to you, place ever-increasing value on the buying journey, and have a
greater sense of responsibility to move toward an outcome.

Getting Caught Up in Emotion
It's easy to get caught up in the moment with eager prospects that seem engaged—
especially when they make you feel that a sale is imminent. You become the prospect's
puppet and skip steps in the sales process. Eagerness is a disruptive emotion that
creates impatience, causes you to misjudge win probabilities, and clouds situational
awareness.
Recently a heavy equipment company contacted one of my sales reps about having me
deliver a keynote at their annual sales kickoff meeting. Randy hit all the right notes—he
was interested, upbeat, and eager to meet with me. My sales rep was convinced it was
a done deal. All Randy and his boss, Tim, wanted before committing to a date was a
few minutes one-on-one with me.
As soon as I got on the phone with Randy and Tim, it was evident that Randy was an
influencer (see “The Five Stakeholders You Meet in a Deal”) and the decision was in his
boss Tim's hands. I asked questions about outcomes and what they wanted to
accomplish. Randy gave long answers, and his boss short answers. Something was
amiss.
So, I asked Tim a direct question: “Tim, I'm sensing that you aren't entirely on board
with me keynoting your meeting. Am I missing something?”
The first engagement test: My question was designed to get him to open up and come
clean.
He responded that the previous year they'd brought in an outside speaker who'd done a
poor job. The speaker didn't get to know them, gave a generic talk, and basically bored
the audience. Because of the experience, Tim was less than enthusiastic about bringing
in another speaker from the outside.
Result: He told me the truth. I learned he was bringing emotional baggage from another
buying experience into the conversation, and if I was unable to minimize this baggage
there would be no deal. I learned that hiring me was not Tim's idea. Randy, the sales
leader who first called us, was pushing his boss to hire me. If this did not become Tim's
idea, then there would be no deal.
Tim complained for a few more minutes about the previous year's speaker and then
asked that I send over some information about me.

The second engagement test: “Tim, based on what I'm hearing, it feels like you have
questions that need to be answered before you can trust me with your team. Why don't
we do this first? I'm going to send over a couple of references. You can call these
clients and ask them anything about me. Then let's get together and decide whether it
makes sense to move forward after you've had a chance to speak with them. How about
the same time next Friday?”
Result: To test his engagement, I asked for two micro-commitments: (1) agree to call
the references and (2) commit to a next step. He agreed to call the references, but it
was not an enthusiastic response. He did not agree to meet with me on Friday and
instead pushed that off on Randy, who readily agreed to the meeting. Win probability at
this point had moved from my rep's “sure thing” to less than 50 percent.
The final engagement test: I hung up the phone and immediately e-mailed Tim the
contact information for my two references. The next test was whether he would match
my effort.
Clue One: There was no response to my e-mail.
Clue Two: A day later I called my references to find out if they had been contacted by
Tim or Randy. They had not. Two more days passed and the references still had not
been contacted.
My conclusion: Not engaged, not going to get engaged, not worth my time. I sent
Randy and Tim a note and canceled the Friday meeting.
Epilogue: Randy called back two weeks later to find out if I was still available.
Apparently, Tim had come around. I'd spent no time chasing them and no time worrying
about them. They came back to me, and when they did it was on my terms. We no
longer had the original date open, and they agreed to change their meeting date to
accommodate my schedule. This happens often—the prospect comes back when you
are willing to walk away.
Asking for and getting micro-commitments, and consistently getting to the next step,
accelerates pipeline velocity. Deals with forward momentum have a higher win
probability and a lower chance of stalling. This is why you must never, ever leave a
conversation with a stakeholder without a firm next step.
You should always be testing engagement—on every call and in every conversation. If
engagement is not there, your deal will die. Sometimes fast. Sometimes slowly. But
nonetheless certain death.
It is reasonable to deduce, if stakeholders are making and keeping commitments, that
they are both engaged and committed to the process. However, engagement is not
always quantifiable. At the purely emotional level it is something you perceive, sense,
and intuitively know is there. It's human. You can feel it in your gut. You simply need to
turn on awareness.

You'll often find ultra-high performers carrying around a pocketful of yeses. Each time a
stakeholder agrees to a commitment, a change, an idea, a perceived future state, or a
recommendation, the UHP collects the yes and holds on to it.
Should the stakeholder get cold feet when facing change (and they often do), the UHP
puts the yeses on the table, thus triggering dissonance and helping the stakeholder
move past the fear of change and on to the next commitment.

14
STALLED DEALS AND NEXT STEPS
Whoever wants to reach a distant goal must take small steps.
—Saul Bellow
This is dialogue from an actual pipeline review:
Me:

“So what's the next step?” [I'm pointing to the 11th deal down on the sales rep's pipeline report. Not one of the previous opportunities
we'd discussed had a solid, scheduled next step.]

Sales
rep:

“Um, well, I'm calling her back next week.”

Me:

“What day and time is your appointment?”

Sales
rep:

“She just said to give her a call.”

Me:

“You mean ‘Call me maybe’? How is that a next step?”

Sales
rep:

“Well, she seemed interested in getting a proposal.”

Me:

“Okay, let's keep this real. Out of the 17 deals in your pipeline, how many do you have a set meeting with on your calendar and theirs?”

Sales
rep:

“Maybe three of them.”

Me:

[Staring back incredulously.]

Sales
rep:

“You don't understand. It's not like that.”

Me:

“Like what?”

Sales rep:

“In my industry people won't set meetings.”

Me:

“Really? That's interesting. You mean on our calls this afternoon—the ones you scheduled meetings with on the phone—if we were to
ask to schedule a follow-up meeting to present a proposal, 100 percent of them would tell us to go pound sand because they don't
schedule meetings.”

Sales
rep:

“Well, no. That's not what I'm saying. It's just hard.”

Me:

“Okay, let me ask you a question. Be honest. When you schedule the next meeting, what is your close rate?”

Sales
rep:

[Thinking…] “I guess pretty high.”

Me:

“And when they don't schedule the next step?”

Sales
rep:

“Honestly?”

Me:

“Yes.”

Sales
rep:

“I make a lot of follow-up calls but usually don't hear from them again.”

This rep's pipeline velocity was slower than molasses. Most of the prospects had been
stalled for months and he was calling and calling just checking in.

The Bane of Sales Organizations
Stalled deals plague the sales profession, clogging pipelines, ruining forecasts, and
causing untold frustration. From the CEO to frontline sales reps, everyone seems to be
looking for ways to unstick deals. And, of course, from top to bottom, everyone wants to
shorten sales cycles and increase pipeline velocity.
When I'm called in to work with sales teams, the two most common issues holding
organizations back are prospecting (not getting enough into the pipeline) and pipeline
congestion (not getting enough out of the pipeline).
When pipelines are congested, the root cause is almost always the same: salespeople
are failing to consistently ask for and get commitments for next steps.
Of course, sometimes deals stall because the salesperson is stuck with a low-level
influencer and either unwilling to level up to a decision maker or too afraid to move past
a blocker and risk the relationship.
Sometimes deals stall because there never was a deal in the first place and the
salesperson did a poor job with qualifying.
In other cases deals stall even though you've done everything right. In sales, that's life.
You won't win them all.

The primary reason that deals stall, though—90 percent of the time or more—is the
failure to ask for and get next steps. Getting micro-commitments along the way not only
tests engagement but keeps your deal moving steadily forward.

The Cardinal Rule of Sales Conversations
A few months ago, I was riding with Ken, one of my client's sales representatives. After
our first call of the day I asked two questions:
1. “How do you think that call went?”
2. “Did you achieve your call objective?”
“I think it went well. The prospect was happy to see us and he seemed interested in
doing business with us [delusion]. I think it was a great outcome considering that it took
me almost two months to get him to meet with me.”
“What's the next step?” I replied (knowing the truth).
Ken looked down at his meeting notes. “Well, I'm going to go back and put something
together, and then he said to give him a call in a couple of weeks to schedule another
meeting to go over our proposal.”
“Ken, why didn't you schedule the next appointment while you were right there, sitting in
front of him?”
“I didn't want to seem too pushy [disruptive emotion].”
“Is he easy to get in touch with?”
“No. He is never in the office, but he told me to call him so I'm sure he'll take my call.”
All I could do was shake my head. I reached out to Ken a month later to ask about the
account. He told me that he'd been unable to schedule the meeting to go over the
proposal with his prospect. “I just don't understand it—he seemed so interested. I keep
leaving messages to check in, but he doesn't return my calls.”
Ultra-high performers (UHPs) follow a simple cardinal rule of sales meetings:
Never leave a meeting with a stakeholder, whether in person or on the phone, without
setting and committing to a firm next step. Ever!
Let me be clear. Statements like “I'll call you next week” or “Just call me when you are
ready” are not firm next steps.
A firm, committed next step requires a commitment to action from both you and your
stakeholder—and a date on which you will meet again by phone or in person to review
those actions. Finally, that date must be written in stone on your calendar and your
stakeholder's calendar. If you leave next steps up to a hope and a prayer, your deals
will stall.
Prospects are so crazy busy that as soon as you leave or hang up the phone they have
already forgotten about you and moved on to the next pressing issue on their priority
list. If you don't have a firm date set on their calendar for the next time you will meet, it

will be difficult if not impossible to get that commitment once you are out of sight and
mind.
Sometimes salespeople get so caught up in the excitement of a successful sales call
that they just forget to ask. Trust me, I've been there and done that. The key to avoiding
this is to develop a habitual call routine that helps you remember to gain commitment for
the next step at the conclusion of every call.
Some salespeople, like Ken, falsely believe that being assertive when setting the next
step will sound rude or pushy. I assure you that it does not. Instead, you sound
professional and organized. Your prospect will respect your attention to detail and
appreciate that you value their time enough to schedule next steps and keep the
process moving along.
Average salespeople are afraid to ask for the demo, the facility tour, leveling up to the
decision maker, data for building a business case, the next meeting, or the sale. The
fear of asking permeates every client interaction and leaves them making excuses for
why prospects never call back and nothing ever seems to close.
Trust me, the pain of a stalled pipeline, endless calls back to disengaged stakeholders,
and making excuses to sales management are far worse than having a prospect say no.
It is important to understand that as a sales professional it is your job to keep the ball
rolling, and you should never expect your prospect to do this for you.
To reach ultra-high performance you must risk rejection. This requires courage.
Courage is like a muscle that must be exercised regularly to develop and grow strong.
Once you begin taking small risks, you will find that your fear of rejection is often
unfounded. Your prospects will agree to next steps much more often than you think.

Getting Past the Next-Step Brush-Off
You must be firm and assertive about keeping your deals moving forward one microcommitment, one meeting, and one step at a time. This means always, always, always
asking for and nailing down the next step.
But, when you ask for next steps, you're going to get brush-offs. Trust me, your
prospects have better things to do than hang out with you. Frankly (this may be hard for
you to hear), they would rather spend the afternoon getting a root canal than spend 15
minutes with you.
Judo, a Japanese word that translates as “gentle or yielding way,” is a martial art form
that focuses on winning without causing injury. Similarly, with next-step requests, you
want to achieve your objective—a commitment of time or information—without fighting
or causing injury.
The key is being nimble, adaptive, and quick on your feet. To be agile, you need to
deploy a simple turnaround framework for both managing your emotions and pulling
your stakeholders toward you, making it easier for them to say yes.
The three elements of this turnaround framework are (Figure 14.1):

1. Ledge
2. Disrupt
3. Ask

Figure 14.1 Turnaround Framework Elements

Ledge
As you've learned, the fight-or-flight response to rejection is involuntary. The purpose of
the ledge statement is to give your logical brain the millisecond that it needs to catch up
and get control of the disruptive emotions caused by the stakeholder rejecting your next
step request, allowing you to regain your poise.
Ledge statements include:


That's exactly why I asked.



That makes sense.



Many of my clients felt the same way before…



That's fantastic.



How so?



Many of my competitors are happy to do that without a complete
understanding of your unique situation.

Because you tend to get the same responses to next-step requests again and again,
ledges need to be memorized, practiced, repeatable, and sound like you. When you
perfect the ledge, you'll never have to worry about what to say, giving you complete
control over your emotions.

A practiced ledge makes your voice intonation, speaking style, and flow sound relaxed,
authentic, and professional. It frees your mind to focus on your strategy and next move
rather than reacting inappropriately to the disruptive emotions triggered by the fight-orflight response.

Disrupt
Your prospects are conditioned. They expect you to act just like every other
salesperson. When they tell you no, they expect you to fold up, go away, and just check
in.
The secret to turning around your stakeholder's reflex response or brush-off is delivering
a statement that disrupts this expectation, takes away the fight, and pulls them toward
you. For example:
When they say they're busy, instead of arguing how you will only take a little bit of their
time, say:
“I figured you would be. That's why I want to find a convenient time on your schedule to
meet next week.”
Agreeing with them disrupts and paints their expected pattern.
When they ask you to just e-mail a proposal or pricing, say:
“Most of my competitors are willing to do that without a good understanding of your
unique situation. They have a box and ask their clients to fit into that box. My company,
on the other hand, builds the box around you. That's why I need to learn more about
your unique situation.”
When they say “Just give me a call next week,” respond:
“Gosh, I'd love to but we have so many new customers coming on board right now that I
don't think I'll have time on my schedule. Why don't we set a time to meet now, so I can
give you the attention you deserve?”

Disrupting with the Take-Away Technique
Keith was on the initial call with a potential consulting client. He'd shifted into discovery,
but his intuition told him that his stakeholder, the vice president of human resources,
was holding back. From conversations with other stakeholders and his own research,
Keith had learned that there were severe problems and pain with the process of
managing the company's benefits plan.
Yet in answering Keith's questions the stakeholder talked as if everything was okay—
brushing over the issues Keith knew were there. With the conversation going nowhere,
Keith deployed a take-away to test engagement and pull the stakeholder back in.
“Well, Roy, based on everything you've told me, it sounds like you and your team are
doing a bang-up job managing the benefits plan and enrollment for your employees. It
doesn't sound like there is much we can help you with.”

Then he shut up and waited for what he knew would happen. (A calm, relaxed delivery
and silence are critical to making a take-away work.)
After a few seconds of silence, Roy responded,
“Ah, no…um, we want to find a way to have you come in and work with us. We are
doing a lot right, but there are some things that we need another set of eyeballs on.”
Like a magnet, the take-away disrupted Roy's expectations for how Keith would behave
and pulled him back in.
Question: What's the one thing we want more than anything else?
Answer: What we can't have.
When something is taken away from you, your attention is heightened and suddenly you
want it. For this reason, take-aways—even very subtle take-aways—pull stakeholders
toward you, flip their script, and give you control of the situation.
In essence, the take-away is noncomplementary behavior. Instead of responding in kind
to their brush-off, you pull back, snapping them out of their pattern.

Leveraging the Perceived Scarcity Effect
If something is perceived to be scarce or exclusive, it is seen as being more valuable. If
something is scarce and another person wants it, you want it more. It's called the
perceived scarcity effect and it can be leveraged in getting stakeholders to agree to next
steps.
For example, if you say, “I'm open to whatever works best for you,” when setting a nextstep appointment, you increase the likelihood that your stakeholder will respond, “Why
don't you just give me a call? I'll be around.”
But if instead you say, “I've got a packed schedule next week. Why don't we get a
meeting booked before someone else takes your slot? How about Wednesday at 2:30
PM?” The probability that your stakeholder will take that time slot or negotiate for
another time slot is very high.
The easiest way to make someone want something is to make it scarce. People want
what they can't have.

Ask
You may deliver the perfect turnaround, but if you don't ask again for a commitment,
you won't get what you want. Don't wait for your stakeholder to do your job for you. You
must ask confidently and assumptively for the next step—without any hesitation or
awkward pause—directly following your turnaround. If you don't ask, you'll lose the next
step.
The benefit to gaining next-step commitments is enormous. Asking for the next step
exposes buyers that are not engaged. When they push off commitments or dismiss your
attempts to gain a commitment with vague “call me maybe” statements, you get a clear

picture that the deal is not going to move forward. This frees you up to invest your time
with prospects who will engage.
Consistently getting to the next step gives you momentum, and each micro-commitment
your stakeholder makes causes them to be more committed to you. As you keep your
deals moving forward, you'll start closing at a far more rapid pace. By investing your
time in viable deals with engaged prospects, you shorten the sales cycle and accelerate
pipeline velocity.

The Three Words You Should Never Use in Sales
There are circumstances in which you will be unable to get a next step. It's not optimal,
but in the real world it happens. You will be forced to leave a proposal or to send
product specs, price lists, or other information without the benefit of a firm next step.
Then you'll need to follow up. Sadly, most follow-up calls fail because they sound like
this:
“Hi, Justin, it's Ken. I'm just checking in to see if you've had a chance to look at that
information I sent you.”
Just checking in—the three words you should never use in sales—have become a
ubiquitous phrase used by salespeople everywhere.
I've used “just checking in” and I'll bet my next book royalty check that “just checking in”
has crossed your lips, too. But here's the thing, “Just checking in” is a useless phrase.
It adds no value, fails to engage stakeholders in real dialogue, elicits mindless reflex
responses from stakeholders who shut you down, and moves you no closer to getting
the deal done. It's a bad habit and a passive way to follow up.
Your imperative as a sales professional is to keep your deals progressing steadily
through the pipeline. This is the primary reason why just checking in (much like hope) is
not a sales strategy.
You've got to ask specifically for what you want. You've got to be direct. You've got to
be assumptive rather than passive. This, by the way, is a core trait of ultra-high
performers—who ask for what they want and assume they will get what they ask for.
When you just check in, you passively and pathetically assume that you are going to
lose.
Pay attention! Just checking in does not sell your product or service. It does not move
deals forward. It is a useless phrase.
Just checking in is stalling your deals, holding you back, and it is time to kick the habit.

15
SALES PROCESS
You should never allow someone else to dictate your sales process.
—Mike Weinberg
Jeffrey Gitomer, author of The Little Red Book of Selling (Bard Press, 2004) and his
Sales Bible (John Wiley & Sons, new ed., 2015), is one of the most prolific authors in
the sales space. He has sold more than a million books and risen to celebrity status in
the sales profession. I once walked through the Charlotte, North Carolina, airport with
Jeffrey. People were coming up to him from every direction to shake his hand or get an
autograph. They were even introducing their children to “The King of Sales.”
In his home is an impressive library, including what is likely the most comprehensive
collection of sales books in the world. Whenever I'm there, I find myself staring into the
bookshelves, mesmerized, just trying to take it all in.
In the center of the library surrounded by these books is Gitomer's favorite writing chair.
And it was there in the library that we engaged in a deep conversation about the sales
process.
“Look at all these books.” Gitomer waved at the shelves—school was in session.
“There's so much that's been written about sales, but I can simplify all of it. Sales is a
process—a completely predictable process. Follow the steps and you close deals. Skip
steps and you lose.”
Sales is a process. I'd heard and said those words more times than I could remember.
Sales is a process is the mantra of sales trainers, the hero and main character of
countless sales books, and a shape-shifting chameleon that takes on different forms,
labels, acronyms, and layers as the complexity and length of the sales cycle increases.
The burning question is why, after all the investment that companies have made
teaching salespeople the sales process, do salespeople ignore it and skip steps?
It is a linear, logical process that, when fully leveraged, guarantees a higher win
probability. It just doesn't make sense to ignore it, which is why, if you drive around to
the back of office buildings, you'll find rows of sales managers banging their foreheads
against the bricks.
There are four reasons salespeople fail to effectively leverage the sales process:
1. Disruptive emotions
2. Winging it
3. Complexity
4. No sales process

Disruptive Emotions Disrupt the Sales Process
You don't need me or anyone else to lecture you on the steps of the sales process and
what they mean. Most salespeople are familiar with the sales process, are aware that
the sales process is important, and understand the consequences of skipping steps.
Most sales organizations have defined and perfected a simple, easy-to-execute sales
process with steps that are appropriate to their sales cycle and product complexity.
These organizations also provide sales process training programs for their salespeople.
Yet many talented, educated, well-trained salespeople consistently crash and burn in
the sales process (go back to that image of sales managers banging their heads against
brick walls).
The problem is not logical, and it's not a training problem—it's emotional.
The most frequent reason salespeople fail in the sales process is the inability to
regulate and manage disruptive emotions. These disruptive emotions, including
impatience, fear, desperation, eagerness, doubt, hope, insecurity, ego, and more,
impede situational awareness, causing salespeople to ignore, skip, or mangle steps in
the sales process.
The lack of self-control is the most fundamental reason why salespeople fail in the sales
process and lower win probabilities. They push too hard, lose control, overestimate win
probability, talk over prospects, and, far too often, skip steps.
Where ultra-high performers (UHPs) separate themselves from the masses of average
salespeople is their ability to marry intellectual understanding of the linear sales process
with sales-specific emotional intelligence.

Winging It
Gitomer is right. Sales outcomes are predictable based on how salespeople leverage,
execute, and move deals through the sales process. Follow a well-designed sales
process with qualified prospects that are in the buying window, and you will close more
deals. It's the truth and it's a guarantee.
Sadly, many salespeople discount this basic truth and wing it because they, in the
words of one poor performer, “I don't like to be constrained by rules.” These salespeople
prefer to chart their own course, in the delusional belief that their way is better. Trust
me. It's not. Winging it is stupid.
Ultra-high performers prepare in advance for sales calls. Pre-call planning can be as
simple as doing a little bit of research and scratching down some notes when working
short-cycle, low-complexity deals, or as extensive as developing detailed stakeholder
profiles and tying preplanning into a comprehensive account sales strategy with
complex deals.
Regardless of account complexity, there are four basic pre-call planning questions you
need to answer before each sales call:

1. What do you already know, including information you can find without asking
your prospect?
2. What do you want to know or learn in your meeting?
3. What is your meeting objective?
4. What is your targeted next step?
These questions should be asked and answered prior to every meeting with a
stakeholder.

What You Already Know
Anthony's company helps employers hire top-tier talent with hiring assessments. When
Anthony and his team were courting a large furniture seller, they shopped the company
first. “We went into the store and took in the entire experience. By posing as customers
we learned about their sales process, the types of people they hire, and their culture.”
Anthony continued, “When we showed up for our initial discovery meeting, we explained
to the stakeholder group what we had done. They were beyond impressed that we'd
invested time to get to know them. You could feel the emotional shift in the room. We
walked in as salespeople and out as partners. Today, they are one of our largest
customers.”
Learn everything possible about the organization and the people you are meeting with
in advance. Leverage technology, social media, and the Internet to gather information
about stakeholders and their organizations. This has four benefits.
1. It helps you avoid asking stupid questions that demonstrate your lack of
preparation.
2. It helps you craft easy questions that get your stakeholder talking.
3. You begin learning to speak your prospect's language.
4. It makes your stakeholder feel important because you provide tangible
evidence that you cared enough to invest effort in getting to know them.
Through preplanning and strategy, UHPs develop theories and hypotheses that can be
tested through questioning.

What You Want to Know
Throughout the sales process you are tasked with building the case for why the
prospect's stakeholders should choose you and your product. This case begins and
ends with discovery. Each time you meet with a stakeholder, your objective is to gather
information that helps you put this puzzle together.
Before your call, you must have a clear understanding of what you want to learn. This is
how you define your call objective. Once you have determined what you want or need to
know, in order to move to the next step, develop and practice the questions you will ask
during your meeting.

Meeting Objectives and Targeted Next Steps
Every sales call should have a simple and easy-to-explain objective so that both you
and your stakeholder know why you are there and what you hope to accomplish. Your
objective should be aligned with where you are in the sales process.
Likewise, you should have a clearly defined, targeted next step aligned to the sales
process. Before you go into any meeting with a stakeholder, ask and answer two
questions.
1. What's my objective?
2. What's my targeted next step?
If you can't definitively answer these questions, you'll be winging it and wasting their
time, and the probability that you'll walk out of your meeting without a next step will be
high.

Complexity Is the Enemy of Execution
Sometimes sales organizations create complexity in the sales process where there
should be simplicity. This happens for two primary reasons:
1. The leadership team (or worse, a committee of people) breaks the process
into far too many steps—usually in an effort to manage and measure the
pipeline to the nth degree inside the customer relationship management
(CRM) system. In their quest for data and visibility, they unknowingly hinder
their sales organization, handcuff their salespeople, and steal time from highvalue sales activities.
2. The organization, in an effort to be truly unique, creates complicated
“business-speak” labels for the sales process steps that make no earthly
sense to normal human beings except MBAs from big-money B-schools.
Recently I was interviewing a sales rep about his company's sales process in
preparation for a keynote speech. This company invests heavily in sales training and is
very proud of its unique sales process. Yet the rep said to me, when I asked him to walk
me though the steps, “Hold on, I think there is a poster in the conference room with the
steps on it.”
What do you think the chance is that this rep is executing the process effectively in the
field? Complexity only serves to befuddle salespeople.
Some people feel a need to create complexity out of simplicity because they believe it
makes them look smarter. They cannot accept that simple works.
It's a lot easier to make simple things complex than to make complex things simple.
Steve Jobs famously said, “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard
to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you
get there, you can move mountains.”
Complexity is the enemy of execution. Real genius is making the complex simple.

No Sales Process
To be fair, there is another group of salespeople who've never been taught to follow a
defined sales process or don't have a sales process. This problem primarily affects
independent sales professionals, sole proprietors, and salespeople working for small
companies and start-ups that lack a functioning sales training infrastructure.
There is a basic Seven-Step Sales Process (Figure 15.1) that applies to virtually every
sales situation, product, service, and industry. Yes, there may be different substeps or
monikers, but from my work with some of the largest and most successful sales
organizations, I've found that their sales processes are all built on this seven-step
foundation.

Figure 15.1 Seven-Step Sales Process

Prospecting and Qualifying
Every sales process begins with top-of-funnel sales-development activity. Ultra-high
performers are fanatical prospectors that relentlessly and systematically engage and
move the most qualified high-probability prospects into the pipeline when the buying
window opens.
The key to effective prospecting is a balanced approach that leverages multiple
prospecting channels, including the phone, e-mail, social, in-person, networking, and
referrals, to connect with prospects at the right time and with the right message.
For a deeper dive into prospecting and demand generation, read Fanatical Prospecting.

Connecting
In most sales training programs and sales process diagrams, this step is referred to as
“building rapport.” This step is focused primarily on building emotional connections with
the various stakeholders involved in the buying process.
In the context of the sales process, the connecting step is generally the initial meeting
with a stakeholder. Your focus is on lowering emotional barriers, setting the agenda,
defining the sales and buying process, gaining control, and qualifying.
The connecting step is where you and your stakeholders decide if it makes sense to
move to the next step and invest time in the sales and buying process.
Stakeholders will want to move forward if you've built enough interest and credibility to
compel them to invest more time with you. You will want to move forward if you feel

your win probability is high enough to justify a next step and further investment of time
and resources.

Discovery
Discovery is the process of building your case. It's about asking questions and listening.
Often called fact finding or needs analysis, discovery is the most important step in the
sales process and where 80 percent or more of your time should be spent.
Discovery is the heart of the sales process. Depending on the complexity of the deal,
discovery may last a few minutes or span many months and meetings with a broad
array of stakeholders.
During discovery, ultra-high performers are patient and strategic, methodically building
their case with powerful questions that shake stakeholders from their comfort zones.
They leverage strategic, artful, provocative, and challenging questions to create selfawareness in stakeholders for the need to change.
Except for putting the right deals into the pipeline in the first place, nothing you do in the
sales process has a greater impact on win probability than effective discovery.

Bridging
To build a rock-solid case for doing business with you, you must build a bridge from
your offerings, recommendations, or solutions to your stakeholder's unique pain,
problems, and opportunities.
In the context of a sales conversation (including demos) informal bridges give your
prospect a compelling reason to move forward to the next step. When closing, bridging
is accomplished through a formal presentation or proposal. In most sales process
diagrams this is called presenting.
Ultra-high performers differentiate by creating personalized recommendations and
bridging from solutions to their stakeholder's problems, using the stakeholder's
language rather than their own.

Asking
Asking is a core discipline of sales. If you don't ask, you don't get. In most sales process
diagrams this step is called closing. I prefer asking because asking for what you want is
the key.
Over the course of the sales process you'll be asking for micro-commitments. These
micro-commitments are the small steps that move your deal forward through the sales
process. Once you've made your final case, you'll ask for the sale.
There are no tricks or secret techniques. Ultra-high sales performers find asking is easy
because they have earned the right to ask.
Because they've systematically followed the sales process, developed emotional
connections with stakeholders, asked questions and listened, built relevant bridges, and
thus increased win probability, their confidence in getting a yes is high.

The art is situational awareness and emotional control—knowing when to ask, how to
ask, what to ask for, and when you've earned the right to ask.

Objections and Negotiating
Stakeholders are going to hit you with objections. They will negotiate. It is a fact of life.
Even in perfect situations with all the ducks in a row, you will still be hit with challenging
questions and need to work out win-win compromises.
Average salespeople succumb to disruptive emotions, often at the first hint of pushback.
Rather than negotiate, they give discounts. Rather than working through objections,
they acquiesce and leave the playing field.
Ultra-high performers embrace objections and negotiation. They recognize that when a
stakeholder is throwing out objections or negotiating, that person is engaged. The more
engaged the stakeholder, the higher the win probability.

Implementation and Account Management
Depending on the responsibilities of your sales role, you may be involved in the delivery
or implementation of your product or service and/or managing and growing the account.
Flawless implementation is the key to getting testimonials that bolster credibility and
referrals that are often your best-qualified prospects.
Effective account management is the key to retaining hard-fought business and growing
highly profitable revenue.
Average salespeople take on the entire burden themselves and get bogged down in the
minutiae of implementation and account management, leaving them with little time for
selling. Ultra-high performers leverage their support teams to back them up and take
care of customers. They thereby gain more time to focus on high-value activities that
increase their income.

Aligning the Three Processes of Sales
Mastery of the sales process alone, regardless of how you choose to define and
practice it, is not enough for ultra-high performance. Salespeople who master the sales
process intellectually and emotionally can still fall short. This is because they become
too myopic inside the sales process and lose sight of the bigger picture—aligning the
three processes of sales.

Sales Process

Buying Process

Decision Process

Your defined process for selling

Your prospect's defined process for buying

Stakeholders' process for deciding

Linear

Formal or informal

Emotional

Organizational

Linear

Nonlinear

Measured

Organizational

Individual

Inflexible

Unique

Irrational

Impacted by disruptive emotions

Measured and objective

Influenced through human interaction

Shaped with strategy

When these processes are aligned, serendipity happens. Yet they are almost never
aligned, because salespeople—as conditioned by trainers—focus almost exclusively on
their own self-centric process designed to move (and in the worst cases manipulate)
prospects from one point to the next.
Ultra-high performers see the bigger picture beyond the sales process and focus on
aligning the three processes of sales. This is the real secret to increasing win probability
and making sales outcomes predictable.

BUYING PROCESS
I've come to learn that my initial investment is more about the person versus the
product that I am buying into.
—Daymond John
Most large companies have a formal, defined process for buying. Smaller organizations
at a minimum have an informal buying process. The buying process is typically a check
and balance to ensure that the company's stakeholders are making good decisions with
the company's money.
Typically, the more complex the sale, the more formal and defined the buying process.
In low-complexity, low-risk, and short-cycle situations, the buying process will often be a
single person (perhaps the business owner) making a simple yes or no decision or an
informal “Before we do anything we have to review it with Mary.”

Mapping the Buying Process
When working mid- to long-cycle complex deals, it is imperative that you understand
your prospect's buying process. You'll need to know the steps that are involved and the
stakeholders' expectations and timing for moving through those steps. You'll also want
to map the stakeholders involved, their role in the organization, and their influence on
each step of the buying process.
Nailing down and mapping the buying process isn't easy or cut and dried.


Stakeholders may obscure the process because they feel doing so gives
them a negotiating advantage.



Sometimes stakeholders don't have access to the bigger picture and you
may only uncover isolated slices of the process, leaving out vital steps.



In other cases stakeholders have a difficult time walking you through their
buying process because they don't view it as a process.

It is imperative that you ask about the process and keep asking. This is a foundational
part of qualifying. Once you understand how your potential clients buy, you'll begin the
hard work of bending their buying process to align with your sales process.

The Danger of Getting Out of Sync
When I took over as vice president of corporate accounts at early childhood education
company La Petite Academy, aside from an existing book of managed accounts, the
sales team hadn't sold a new account in more than five years. If that wasn't shocking
enough, there was a fully staffed bid desk that responded to several new requests for
proposals (RFPs) each month.

On-site child care is a complex sale. Installing an on-site child care facility on a
company's campus involves a big risk for the prospect and a big risk for the vendor.
Sales cycles are long and the costs are in the millions of dollars. The buying process
includes surveys and studies, employee committees, RFPs, tours, vetting of the
vendors, risk assessments, and approval at the officer, and sometimes board, level.
La Petite ran on-site facilities for a wide cross section of employers and government
facilities. It had a great reputation and the capabilities to design, build, and manage
early childhood education programs on corporate campuses. It had the credibility and
the staff to provide any variety of curriculum. Yet, the sales team was getting beaten by
competitors on every deal.
Our CEO was frustrated, the board was asking hard questions, and I was on the hot
seat to fix the problem quickly.
I spent the better part of a month analyzing the requests for proposals submitted and
lost over the previous two years. Everything seemed to be in line, but something kept
nagging at me—it didn't make sense that we'd lost every bid for five years running.
Then a new RFP landed at the bid desk. As I observed the process from start to finish,
the answer to why we were losing every deal became obvious.
On-site childcare facility RFPs are thick, four to six inches thick. They are complicated
and complex, and require a team of people to complete. The process takes several
weeks and sucks up significant resources. In our case, it was a significant waste of
resources.

My first question to the
sales team:

“Did you know in advance that this RFP was going to be issued?”

The response:

“No, most RFPs are sent to us without any prior contact. Sometimes we'll get a call looking for information
on where to submit an RFP and we give them our address.”

My next question:

“Does anyone have a relationship with this prospect?”

Response:

[Crickets]

Next question:

“Who is speaking to the prospect now and establishing a relationship?”

Response:

[Crickets]

Next question:

“Why aren't you speaking to the prospect?”

Response:

“The RFPs almost always give explicit instructions that we are not to contact anyone at the company.
There is usually a person named in the RFP we can send questions to via e-mail.”

Me, incredulously:

“So you never actually speak to a person? You just do all this work, submit the RFP, and wait to see what
happens?”

Response:

“We don't speak to the prospect unless they invite us in after we submit the RFP.”

Me:

“How often does that happen?”

Response:

“Once or twice per year.”

To myself:

OMG! I need to find a brick wall.

Potential clients were defining the buying process via a formal RFP and we had become
their puppets. Through our RFP responses we were helping the buying committee
(almost always made up of stakeholders who were parents with small children and
human resources professionals) do due diligence and build their case.
Our responses were just filling columns on their spreadsheets so they could make a
recommendation to the executive team for a vendor that, the majority of time, they had
already chosen. We were providing free consulting and expending precious resources,
and our probability of winning the deal was essentially zero. We'd have been better off
going down to the convenience store on the corner and buying lottery tickets.
The RFPs came to us randomly and without any influence on the front side before they
were issued. We'd ceded influence to our competitors, who often helped the prospects
build their RFPs, giving our competitors a decided competitive advantage.
Because our competitors started their sales process well before the RFP was issued,
they'd had the chance to build relationships and align their sales process to the buying
process.
We, on the other hand, were starting our sales process deep into the prospect's buying
process. This essentially meant that we were forced to skip the connecting and
discovery steps, putting us at a decided disadvantage.
We had no relationships, no insight, and very little qualifying information (we didn't even
know if it was worth our while to submit the RFP). We had zero influence in a complex,
high-risk deal with a large array of stakeholders. Yet, like robots, we consumed precious
resources responding to RFP after RFP.

Average Salespeople Dance
I realize that most salespeople are not getting RFPs. Many, however, are being pulled
into the prospect's buying process late in the game and being told to dance. And the
average salespeople dance.
They rush headlong into these deals, producing proposals, pitching solutions in the
absence of information, challenging before understanding, blind to the influence of other

stakeholders, and asking without earning the right. Because the buying process and
sales process are out of sync, they skip steps, allow disruptive emotions to drive their
behaviors, and push situational awareness aside. In the process, win probability
plummets.
The outcomes in this paradigm are almost always bad. Deals stall and resources are
wasted on low-probability deals. Salespeople are frustrated because they spend time on
deals that never close, leaders are frustrated because pipelines are unpredictable, and
stakeholders are exasperated because they waste time in shallow, low-value
conversations with average salespeople.
The only group of people winning are ultra-high performers (UHPs), who are shaping
the buying process to both align with their sales process and disrupt the sales process
of their competitors.

Shaping the Buying Process
At La Petite I made an immediate change. We would no longer submit RFPs unless and
until we were first granted an audience with the company's CEO. I made it clear that
spending three weeks and a massive amount of company resources on an RFP with a
zero win probability was going to stop.
Filling out RFPs was not an accomplishment. We needed to close deals. To do that we
had to increase win probability.
How did this move change the game? First, the only person at a company who can
make the decision to spend upward of $20 million on an on-site child care facility is the
CEO. If the company agreed to allow us to meet with the CEO, we would:
1. Know they were serious and the RFP was worth our time and effort (an
engagement test).
2. Gain the insight to build a stakeholder map.
3. Slow down the buying process and align it to our sales process, thus
disrupting our competitors.
This was simple enough. Yet my team resisted. It put them in the emotionally
uncomfortable position of using leverage to get what we wanted. In our case, this meant
reshaping the buying process of potential customers.
“What if they say no?” “That's too aggressive.” “They'll never agree to that.” “We'll lose
all of our opportunities.” Fear, uncertainty, and doubt—disruptive emotions that leave
average salespeople working on low-probability deals.
Ultra-high performers control these disruptive emotions in pursuit of higher win
probabilities. They never waste time filling out a blind RFP or delivering a Hail Mary
proposal because of a fear of missing out (FOMO). Hope is not a strategy or a good
investment of time.

UHPs don't scratch lottery tickets. Instead they put themselves in position to win by
shaping the prospect's buying process to align with their sales process. There are two
primary ways UHPs shape the buying process:


They get there first. UHPs are fanatical prospectors. They begin working
with prospects far ahead of an open buying window. This allows them to
influence the prospect's buying process on the front end.

In this consultative role, they teach buyers how to buy, shape and even write RFPs and
bid specs, lay land mines for competitors, and add, subtract, or change steps in the
buying process. In doing so they increase their win probability while lowering the win
probabilities of competitors.


They use leverage. When UHPs are unable to get in the deal ahead of
competitors, they use leverage to shape the process. Leverage is derived
from something stakeholders want or need: information, comparative pricing,
peace of mind, competing bid. When they don't have leverage, UHPs move
on. When they have leverage, they never give it away for free.

Get There First
It was early on a spring morning. Tony was in his small office. Perhaps “office” is too
kind a description. It was, in truth, a former broom closet. The walls were covered in
dark, cheap wood paneling. The room was no more than four and half feet wide and six
feet long. A small desk had been shoved into it, and that's where he sat each morning
making prospecting calls and setting appointments.
On the wall in front of his desk he'd taped motivational quotes and his sales goal for the
quarter. On the wall behind him were the sales ranking report for the region and his
quarterly sales projections. It was cramped and windowless, but Tony loved it because
it was his space.
Nick, his sales manager, sat on the other side of the paper-thin wall, an arrangement
that had its pros and cons. Nick could easily hear and critique Tony's prospecting calls
without ever getting up from his desk. Tony could overhear Nick's conversations, which
kept him in the know about what was going on around the region and the company.
That morning Nick was on the phone having a conversation with his boss about a new
regulation that would begin impacting the electrical and power-generation industries.
They were discussing strategies for engaging potential customers before their
competitors made a move. Tony's ears perked up.
One of those electrical utilities was headquartered in an open territory. Open territories
were free-for-alls, and the first person to put his or her name on a deal got to keep it.
Tony didn't waste a minute picking up the phone. With no more information than what
he'd overheard from Nick, he called the prospect's environmental health and safety
(EH&S) department.

Through some miracle, he managed to bluff his way past the receptionist. When the
department head, a guy named Casey, answered the phone, Tony's only goal was to
set an appointment. He prayed that Casey wouldn't ask any questions.
Tony introduced himself and asked, “Casey, I'm curious—how do you plan to comply
with the new safety regulation that's going into effect next month and will be impacting
your line crews?”
Casey responded in a relaxed Southern drawl, “Well, that's a good question. We're just
starting to talk about that now. We're not exactly sure what we are going to do, but we
know we'll need to do something soon.”
Not wanting to sound overly anxious, Tony did his best to slow down and relax. “Casey,
that's exactly why I called. We've been watching this thing play out for a while now and
have a number of options available that I thought you and your team might want to kick
around while you figure out your next steps. How about we get together on Friday and
I'll show you what we've been working on?”
“What time are you thinking?” Casey responded.
“How about 10:00 AM?” Tony smiled.
“Great, see you then.”
Fist pump!
Tony strolled into Nick's office just as Nick was hanging up the phone with his boss. He
did his best not to smirk as he gave Nick the good news. “I just booked us an
appointment with the head of EH&S at the biggest electrical utility in the state for Friday
at 10 AM. I'm going to need you to come along on this one because I don't know a thing
about this new reg.”
Tony recalled, “The look on Nick's his face was priceless. Like ‘how in the hell did you
do that?’ priceless. I lived for that look.” Tony laughed as he told the story. “Then we
both panicked. We had three days to become experts on the regulation, understand the
impact to electrical utilities, and develop a strategy for our meeting.”
After meeting with Casey and his team, Nick and Tony realized that they had a monster
deal on their hands. Over the next 60 days they met with Casey seven times and helped
him with the information he would need to formulate his strategy.
By getting to the table first, Tony and Nick influenced, guided, and shaped the buying
process to give themselves the highest possible win probability. In the end Tony and
Nick won the account because they took control from the get-go, built deep and trusting
relationships with the stakeholders, and pushed their competitors into a reactive mode.
Getting there first is the best position to be in when it comes to shaping the buying
process. While other salespeople are being brought into the deal 50 to 80 percent of the
way through the prospect's buying process (and made to dance), you are there from the
very beginning, aligning the buying process to your sales process, guiding your
prospect, building connections, and becoming a valuable resource.

Leverage
In La Petite's case, our leverage was the information being requested in the RFP. There
were a limited number of early childhood education companies capable of setting up
and managing an on-site child care facility. Few companies would be willing to move
forward with such a complex project without researching all the options.
The company issuing the RFP needed our information and cost data for leverage in
negotiations with its preferred partner (the one the committee had already chosen). Our
demand was straightforward: we will provide the information once we have an
opportunity to meet with the CEO and the buying committee.
A few companies outright refused to honor our request. Their refusal told us that they
were on a fishing expedition and did not have executive sponsorship. We ignored those
RFPs, saving time and money.
Most companies balked at our request and responded that we would have to submit the
RFP first. When we politely refused, they almost all relented and set up the meetings.
They needed our information.
These meetings allowed us to reshape and reset the buying process. Once it was
aligned with our sales process, the game changed and our win probabilities soared.
Within 120 days of implementing our new strategy we closed a $16 million deal and
closed 12 more new accounts over the following 18 months.

Average Salespeople Become Buying Process Puppets
If you've been in sales for more than a month, a prospect has said these words (or
something similar) to you in person, on the phone, or via e-mail:


I'm too busy to meet now, but we are interested. Just send me your proposal.
I'll look it over and call you back to set a meeting.



Send over your prices; we're always looking for a better deal. Make sure you
sharpen your pencil.



I'm gathering all the information from vendors. Once we get it all in, we'll start
scheduling meetings.



We're going to be making a decision this week, so we need to get your
information fast. How soon can you send us your proposal?

Ultra-high performers use leverage to gain control in these situations. Average
salespeople with low Sales EQ become buying process puppets.
Take the last example. It's the old “speed you up to slow you down” play. The prospect
indicates that they're interested and about to make a buying decision. “If you want in,
you need to move fast.”

Average salespeople stop what they are doing, spend an afternoon (or an entire day)
putting together the perfect proposal, push their leaders to approve lower prices, deliver
the proposal, put the deal in the pipeline, add it to their forecast, and hope.
Why did this happen? The failure to manage disruptive emotions—desperation, lack of
confidence, fear of missing out, overconfidence effect, and false hope triggered by the
optimism bias.


Becoming a buying process puppet begins with a depleted or empty pipeline.



Empty pipelines make you desperate.



Desperation blinds you to the obvious clues that you are being used.



This opens you up to false hope because hope feels better than desperation.



In your heart of hearts, you know it is a low-potential deal, but you fear that
using leverage to test engagement will cause the prospect to walk away.



Overlooking win probability, and with hope as your strategy, you make a
long-shot promise on your forecast.



You give away your leverage and the prospect disappears.



You miss your forecast, feel like a loser, and your confidence dies.

Ultra-high performers with high Sales EQ respond to these requests with confidence,
reserve leverage, and test engagement by asking for a micro-commitment:
“John, my competitors will be happy to just throw a proposal at you. It's easy for them.
They've got a generic box and expect all their customers to fit into that box.
“This is where we are different. At my company, we build the box around you.
“All I'm going to need is a little bit of your time to ask some questions so I can
understand you better. Then, I'll tailor a proposal around your unique situation. That way
you'll have the opportunity to make a true apples-to-apples comparison and choose the
solution that you feel is best for your company.
“How about we get together tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock?”
UHPs know they'll get one of three possible responses:
1. “That makes sense—when can we meet?” At this point they've gained
control, reshaped the buying process, and obtained the power to align it to
their sales process—most likely disrupting a competitor rep who believed he
or she had the deal wrapped up.
2. “How much time will this take?” or “Is there any other way we can get
you that information?” In this case the buyer is negotiating (read engaged).
The UHP learns that there is urgency and only needs to negotiate how and
when discovery will occur.

3. “Look, we really don't have time to meet. If you want a shot at this, send
us your proposal.” The UHP knows that there is no deal and no chance, so
they walk away, preserving their precious time for a higher-probability play.

THE FIVE STAKEHOLDERS YOU MEET IN A DEAL
You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.
—Jim Rohn
Last summer we decided to run a campaign to generate more buys from advertising
agencies on the Sales Gravy Jobs engine. There were 50 key contacts we wanted to
reach. The campaign would focus on creating awareness of the advancements we'd
made with our mobile job board and apps.
The idea for this campaign originated with me during a marketing brainstorming
session. Our agency account manager, Brooke, liked the idea, so I asked her to
research options for a promotional item we might send by mail along with a brochure
highlighting the improved mobile job board experience.
Brooke searched online for options. She found a few items she liked and contacted the
companies for prices and order minimums. Then she took those ideas to our marketing
manager, Dawn, who contacted Christy, an account manager at a promotional company
Dawn had worked with in the past.
Christy went to work on Brooke's ideas and sent over mock-ups. Dawn took them to our
CFO, Carrie, who made sure the ideas fit into our budget and that we were getting a fair
price. Dawn advocated for using Christy (even though her price was more expensive
than the other vendors' prices). Carrie reviewed the proposals and narrowed them down
to three.
Finally, Brooke, Dawn, and Carrie came to me with their recommendations. Dawn
continued to advocate for Christy. Carrie concurred since Christy seemed more
responsive than the other vendors and Dawn trusted her. I accepted their
recommendations and signed off on the purchase. The entire purchase amount? A
whopping $500.
Let that sink in for a minute. There were four people from my office involved in the
buying process. Four stakeholders for a $500 purchase.

The Higher the Risk, the More Stakeholders Involved
Not every transactional or short-cycle sale involves this many people or this much
thought. When we hired the company that cleans our office, one person made that
decision with zero involvement from anyone else. The risk to our company for making a
poor decision was negligible. The overall value of the cleaning services was 10 times
the purchase amount of the promotional items, but the impact was low.
The higher the risk, the more stakeholders you'll have involved in the sales process.
The stakeholder map will grow with:


Increased risk to the organization



Heightened risk to the individual stakeholders



Complexity of the product or service



Length of the sales cycle

Two years ago I was working with a company that wanted to leverage our online
learning platform, Sales Gravy University, to train its salespeople and sales leaders.
We'd completed discovery, confirmed we were on the right track with the executive
sponsor (our coach), and were set to deliver a final presentation and proposal to the
CEO.
The meeting was scheduled for 10:00 AM at my prospect's corporate headquarters, a
beautiful and sprawling campus. We arrived early and acclimated ourselves to the
meeting room. Looking out at the 22 chairs in the room, I knew this would be a
challenge.
Our coach warned us that there would be a crowd. We'd spent the previous week
researching the players and attempting to understand their motivations. We knew the
CEO liked us, along with his executive vice president. We were aware that the vice
president of sales was not in our corner because he didn't believe his team needed
training.
There were two people from human resources (HR), who wanted to be sure we would
comply with their diversity initiatives; the CIO, who was worried about an online training
platform taking up resources and security issues; three regional directors of sales, who
had been pushing for sales training; the zone manager, who had originally sought us
out; the senior vice presidents of two potential pilot regions, just in case the
stakeholders chose to move forward; and a team of marketing managers, who would be
acting as brand police.
We knew who we had in our corner. We knew who we needed to move into our corner.
We knew the naysayers we needed to neutralize—the vice president of sales and the
CIO. We needed to reassure the HR team and the marketing team that we were on their
side. Finally, we needed to make the sales and operations leaders in the room salivate
to get them to reassure the CEO that she was making the right decision. And we had to
do all of this in 45 minutes.
If reading this makes your head spin, then—trust me—I feel your pain. This is the reality
you face in twenty-first-century sales. There are many stakeholders involved in your
deals. Getting on the wrong side of one of those people or being unaware of a
stakeholder who has influence can sink your chances of closing.

Know Your Audience
We won that deal and it continues to evolve into one of our most profitable relationships.
The key to winning the deal was the work we did in advance of the meeting to set
ourselves up for success.

We began by developing two coaches: our executive sponsor, a senior vice president
with profit-and-loss (P&L) responsibility, and a well-connected director of sales who
wanted us to win the deal. These two stakeholders helped us hone our message, taught
us the company's language, and warned us of pitfalls. They also offered deep insight on
the other stakeholders with whom we'd be interacting.
Leveraging this information, we stepped into each stakeholder's shoes and viewed
things from their perspective.


What are this person's motivations?



What is the risk to them personally for choosing us?



What's the risk of not choosing us?



Why would they be an advocate for us?



Why might they be a naysayer?



What are their emotional hot buttons?



What is their language, and how can we speak it so that it makes them feel
that we get them and their problems?



What makes them feel important? How can we tap into this?



What do they fear?

We knew their names, faces (we pulled pictures of each of them from LinkedIn or the
company's website), background and history, motivations, where they stood relative to a
decision in our favor, level of influence and informal power, and key personal details
that included their college, spouses and children, recent awards, favorite sports teams
or hobbies, and so on.
With this information in hand, we connected in a way no one expected. As they walked
into the room, we shook their hands and greeted them by name. During our
presentation, we demonstrated that we understood them and their problems by weaving
the issues important to them into our message.
When the vice president of sales walked into the room, I could tell that he was openly
hostile. His greeting was terse and he avoided making eye contact. Sadly, this is
common with sales vice presidents, who see my team as a threat rather than a helping
hand. I understand it because when I was a sales vice president I felt the same way. I
was supposed to be the sales expert at my company. If we brought in an outside
consultant, what did that say about me?
So I addressed this emotion right up front by talking about my own experience as an
executive and how I hated it when consultants came into my company and didn't
understand us.
“That's why I promised I would never be that kind of consultant. If we cannot add value,
if we are unwilling to get in the trenches with you, if we can't act as an extra set of hands
to help you reach your goals, then we have the integrity to walk away.”

When the vice president of sales leaned forward and nodded, I knew I'd connected with
him. I was speaking his language.

Hearts Before Minds
When I was a kid, I spent hours sitting in courtrooms watching my lawyer dad try cases.
In the summer, my mom would drop me off at the federal courthouse, which became my
de facto babysitter. I still remember the unique smells and sounds and how everything
seemed so huge and imposing. I'd find a bench near the front of the courtroom and
watch the master.
My dad earned the reputation of being one of the greatest trial lawyers and legal minds
of his generation. When he was trying a case, the opposing attorneys would often give
up before the trial ever started.
My dad is a master at shaping the courtroom and flipping the script in his favor. As he
addressed the jury, he made subtle shifts in his pace, words, voice inflection, accent,
and body language so that each member of the jury perceived that he was speaking
directly to them.
They liked him because he made them feel that he understood them and their
importance. He answered the questions that each jury member would ask about his
client based on that jury member's unique situation. Because of this they trusted and
believed him. Even in the most improbable situations, he swayed juries to return
verdicts in his client's favor.
While the opposing counsel argued the case on facts and logic through self-important
pontification, my dad grabbed the jury members' hearts. And he won, and won, and
won, because he didn't play the same game as everyone else.
It wasn't until I was in college and interning at his office that I experienced first-hand
how he engineered these wins. One of my jobs was researching jury members before
trial. In his office “war room” we created a Jury Map.
On the board, we placed a picture of each potential juror, information about who they
were, their career and family history, why they might find for us, why they might find
against us, emotional hot buttons, cultural background, education, likes, dislikes, fears,
political beliefs, legal history, and many seemingly mundane facts that sometimes
turned out to be very important.
My dad and his team studied the jurors and worked to step into their shoes. For this
reason, my dad defeated most of his competitors before they ever stepped foot into the
courtroom.

BASIC
There are five stakeholders you meet in most deals: Buyers, Amplifiers, Seekers,
Influencers, and Coaches—BASIC. Sometimes stakeholders play multiple roles, and
other times the stakeholder array is large and each has a single part to play.

Beginning with early-stage prospecting and information gathering, through qualifying
and into discovery, ultra-high performers (UHPs) are identifying and mapping BASIC.
They leave nothing to chance. UHPs build relationships and get to know their audience.
Buyers are essentially decision makers, people with the ultimate authority to say yes or
no. There are two types of buyers:
1. Buyers who can authorize the deal, sign a contract or purchase order, and
say yes to the commitment
2. Buyers who can fund the deal and write the check
Sometimes these stakeholders are the same person, and other times they are not. For
example, the CIO may be able to say yes to a new software purchase but until the CFO
agrees to release the funds nothing will happen. A corporate purchaser can say yes to
your terms, and general managers at field locations can say yes to approving the
budget.
Understanding this difference will save you the pain and anguish of closing a deal only
to see the order fail to materialize.
Amplifiers are typically stakeholders who see a problem or gap that your product can
fill. They are advocates for change and amplify the message, problem, pain, or need up
through the organization. These folks can be low or high on the totem pole and have
varying degrees of influence on the outcome of the deal. In most cases, their influence
is indirect. They use the product, are impacted by problems or pain, or perceive an
opportunity. Ultra-high performers are masters at leveraging amplifiers in bottom-up
strategies to push distant decision makers, who may be disconnected from need,
problems, and pain, to take action.
Seekers are stakeholders sent to look for information or who do it on their own. Seekers
are inbound marketing fodder. They download e-books, attend webinars, peruse
websites, and fill out web forms. Usually seekers have little or no buying authority or
influence, yet put up a façade of authority and block access to other stakeholders.
Average salespeople go for this ruse hook, line, and sinker. Many deals are lost
because salespeople give away their leverage early, get stuck with seekers, and allow
disruptive emotions to keep them from moving up to a higher-level stakeholder.
Influencers are stakeholders who play an active role in the buying process. They can
be advocates and on your side, naysayers who are against you, or agnostic. Developing
relationships with influencers is critical in complex sales. Your goal is to develop and
nurture advocates, move agnostics into your corner, and neutralize naysayers.
Coaches or sponsors are insiders who are willing not only to advocate for you but to
help you with insider information. In any complex deal, developing a coach is a huge
competitive advantage. In long-cycle sales where incumbent vendors have a strong
foothold, the absence of a coach or sponsor can put you at such a disadvantage that it
is a disqualifier to continued investment in the opportunity.

The One Question Ultra-High Performers Never Ask
In a recent training session, a sales rep called Ryan grabbed me on a break and asked
this question:
“Jeb, over the past month I've had several of my potential accounts hit a wall because
the person I was working with turned out not to be the decision maker. What is
frustrating to me is these people told me in our initial meeting that they were the
decision maker. I don't understand why people lie to me like that, and I want to know
how I can identify who is telling me the truth and who is not.”
Ryan is not alone in his frustration. Average salespeople often find themselves mired in
stalled deals because they were dealing with the wrong person.
This usually happens because the stakeholder either says outright or insinuates that he
or she is the final decision maker. Believing this to be true, the salesperson goes
through the sales process with the stakeholder: connecting, discovering, presenting
solutions, and asking for the business.
Then bam! Out of nowhere the stakeholder says: “Thank you for this great information,
but I'm going to need to review this with my boss (the committee, my husband, wife,
friend, peers, etc.) before we can make a decision.”
If you've been in this situation, and I bet you have, it makes you want to scream. You try
to get around it by asking for a meeting with their boss, but most of the time it is too late
or they are unwilling to give you access. You fear if you go around them you'll poison
the relationship and lose any hope of closing the deal.
It is an awful conundrum, and the net result is that your deal is stalled. You try to explain
it to your sales manager and put it in the best light. But you've still got egg on your face
because you've been had by your stakeholder. I know. I've been there, done that, and
have the T-shirt to prove it.
How does this happen? How do salespeople get themselves into this situation?
Let's begin with reality. Sometimes there is no way around it. Sometimes you are not
going to get to the decision maker (buyer) and will be stuck working through an
influencer. The key is knowing this up front and adjusting your strategy to align the sales
and buying processes to match reality.
Sometimes you are dealing with a deceitful person who knows how the game is played.
These people have no intention of doing business with you. They're just using you for
free consulting or pricing information to use as leverage with your competitor.
These stakeholders are easy to spot because they are unwilling to engage, resist
emotional connections, renege on commitments, and rush you through the sales
process just to get what they want. Salespeople driven by desperation are the most
likely to get used by this type of prospect.
The most common reason this happens, though, is the salesperson asks one simple but
deadly question:

“Are you the decision maker?”
This is the one question ultra-high performers never ask when qualifying a prospect.
When you ask this question of any stakeholder, 90 percent of the time they are going to
say yes.
Why would a stakeholder lie to you so blatantly? Most stakeholders don't say they are
the decision maker, when they are not, from ill intent. They are not bad people trying to
hurt you.
When you ask a stakeholder, “Are you the decision maker?,” you put them on the spot.
This creates the painful mental stress of cognitive dissonance. If the stakeholder says
no, they are admitting openly that they are not important, which conflicts with their selfimage that they are important.
So, they say yes because it makes them feel significant. They blurt it out without even
thinking.
Then you, the salesperson, reinforce the lie with attention, compliments, and your focus.
It works great for both parties until the moment of truth when you ask for a commitment
and the stakeholder's little house of cards crumbles.
This, by the way, is why your supposed decision maker disappears and your deal stalls.
They are embarrassed to admit that they have little power, have wasted your time, and
are not important.

BASIC Mapping
You must be smart about uncovering stakeholders, intentional with building and
nurturing stakeholder relationships, and strategic in your approach. In mid- to longcycle, complex sales, pigeonholing yourself with a single stakeholder creates risk and
lowers win probability. You must leave nothing to chance.
Begin with research and BASIC mapping. This has become infinitely easier to do with
social media sites like LinkedIn and sales intelligence tools like DiscoverOrg.
Map who's who in the account. You won't always get a complete map. However, even
with incomplete information you can either level-up higher in the organization or develop
questions to get information from the stakeholder without bruising his or her ego.
The most important step you can take, though, is to change your question. Instead of
asking “Are you the decision maker?” use indirect questions such as:


Tell me about your buying policies?



Could you walk me through the buying process?



How does your organization typically make decisions about bringing in new
vendors like my company?



How did you make the decision on this service the last time you signed a
contract?

Indirect questions work because they trigger your stakeholder to tell a story and reduce
their temptation to take the leading role. Most important, you avoid putting them and
their ego on the spot, and that gives you a higher probability of getting a straight answer
so you know exactly where you stand before getting too deeply into the sales process.

18
DECISION PROCESS
It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped.
—Tony Robbins
“Look, you guys are all the same. Why don't you just give me your best price?”
Jessica had heard the same words leave the lips of stakeholders hundreds of times
over a sales career that spanned 15 years and three companies. She knew that the
statement was part negotiating strategy and part truth.
To buyers she and her competitors looked the same. And, frankly, she could see why.
In her industry, there were four national competitors, several dozen regional players,
and local mom-and-pop enterprises dispersed here and there—all vying for a piece of
the action.
The products and services were essentially the same; yet each competitor claimed to
have some exclusive differentiator. These claims were mostly marketing smoke and
mirrors.
To say her industry was competitive was an understatement. It was hypercompetitive.
Among just the four national competitors there were more than 3,000 salespeople
calling on prospects. Add in the regionals and locals, and it was not uncommon for a
stakeholder to get five or more prospecting calls a week.
“I just need five minutes of your time, sir, to show you how we can save your company
money.” The prospecting mantra repeated itself over and over. Weary buyers were
numb to the same stale pitches and sales conversations quickly degenerated into
“What's your best price?”
The pressure on reps in her industry was intense and turnover high, exceeding 100
percent in some cases. To succeed, salespeople had to be relentless. They had to
make 50 to 100 prospecting touches a day just to stay above water—a price that had to
be paid to survive in this industry. Just touch as many prospects as you can, throw out
enough proposals, and you might make it.
As an ultra-high performer (UHP), Jessica refused to play this game. She'd been to her
company's “President's Club” every year for 11 years in a row. At her previous
employer, she'd achieved similar success. As new reps came and went, Jessica was
one of the elite few who understood the key to differentiation.
She leaned forward and set the tablet she'd been given for presentations on the
stakeholder's desk. “Sean, all I want is the opportunity to get to know you and your
company. I want to learn how you do things here, your challenges, and what makes
your company different. Once I have that information, I'll deliver a blueprint for how we
can help you and your team achieve your business goals.”

Jessica continued, “We may find out that it doesn't make sense to work together
because I can bring no additional value other than price. If that is the case, I promise to
tell you. On the other hand, we may find ways to help you become more productive,
drop some real savings to the bottom line, and ultimately make life easier for you.”
Jessica's competitors left Sean's office with marching orders to come back with the best
price. They'd gone back to their offices, met with sales managers, put together generic
PowerPoint presentations, given Sean their best offer, and moved on to the next
prospect. They all looked the same.
Jessica slowed the process down and refused to throw a price on the table. She'd
preserved leverage, managed her emotions, and exercised patience and poise. In doing
so she disrupted and flipped Sean's buyer script. He engaged and agreed to move
forward to the next step (micro-commitment).
Over the next four visits, Jessica observed Sean's processes, interviewed key
managers, built trust and relationships. She uncovered several opportunities to help
Sean's organization become more efficient. She won the trust of his managers and
leveraged their influence on Sean to amplify the need for change. Through effective
discovery she built a case for change. She earned the right to challenge the status quo
and offer solutions to problems that Sean's team were unaware they even had.
When she made her presentation to Sean and his team, her recommendations carried
weight. She articulated her vision in his language, bridging only to what was relevant to
him. Price was important but not the deciding factor in Sean's decision. When he signed
the contract, he did so because Jessica was different.

Influencing the Decision Process
Jessica had access to the same tools, information, products, and rate structure as her
competitors. Each of the salespeople who met with Sean could have approached him in
the same way. Yet only she created real, tangible differentiation.
The average salespeople working for her competitors were oblivious to Sean's motives,
goals, and problems. They made no real attempt to develop an emotional connection or
to work at bringing solutions to the table that might have a positive impact on Sean's
business. Jessica delivered both value and a better emotional buying experience.
What cannot be discounted or overlooked is the undeniable fact 1 that the stakeholder's
emotional experience2 while interacting with a salesperson, as they progress through
the sales and buying process, plays the most significant role in their propensity to
purchase and continue to purchase.3
In other words, the tangible attributes of a product or solution are less important than
the emotions derived on the buying journey, from dealing with you.

Aligning the Three Processes of Sales
Ultra-high sales performers understand that the decision process is the pivot point on
which the sales process and buying process are leveraged.
The sales process and buying process are linear, rational steps developed at the
organizational level. The decision process, on the other hand, is individual, emotional,
nonlinear, and often irrational—in essence, each stakeholder's personal buying journey.
The decision process is how individual stakeholders commit to vendors, products,
services, next steps, and, most important, the salesperson.
Average salespeople forget that in business-to-business sales they are working with
humans who are using someone else's money to solve their own problems and alleviate
pain. Because of this they fail to reach below the surface and gain an understanding of
the motivations, desires, needs, wants, fears, aspirations, and problems of each
stakeholder involved in the buying process. They fail to step into the individual's
emotional shoes.
Ultra-high performers are masters at aligning the sales process, buying process, and
decision process. They never forget that they are dealing with emotional, fallible,
irrational human beings. UHPs know that through emotional connections they move win
probabilities into the stratosphere and create unassailable competitive differentiation.

The Five Questions That Matter Most in Sales
In every sales conversation and throughout the sales process, stakeholders are asking
five questions of you:
1. Do I like you?
2. Do you listen to me?
3. Do you make me feel important?
4. Do you get me and my problems?
5. Do I trust and believe you?
These are the five most important questions in sales. Ultra-high performers get this.
From the first moment they engage stakeholders and until the deal is closed, they are
intensely focused on answering these five questions with an affirmative yes!
The five questions are being asked and answered at both the conscious and
subconscious levels. The questions are emotional. They originate from emotion and are
answered with emotion.
How you answer these questions for each stakeholder will determine the outcome of
your sales conversations—positive or negative—and increase or decrease win
probability. When you answer the five questions in the affirmative, stakeholders are
more willing to comply with your requests for micro-commitments.

Aligning Decision Making with Social Proof
As the complexity of the sale, the length of the cycle, and more importantly the risk to
the organization and individual stakeholders increase, so does size of the stakeholder
array. With more stakeholders in the mix, the risk to the individual stakeholders is
diluted while the risk to you is increased.
With large arrays of stakeholders playing different roles (BASIC), it's easier for
stakeholders to act on groupthink rather than standing up for a view that might be the
right thing but be perceived as unpopular. It's also easier for a single stakeholder to
derail a deal when the stakeholder group is indecisive or misaligned. It's less risky for
the group to side with caution (status quo) than take a risk and be wrong.
What we know empirically about human behavior is that humans follow the crowd. We
are compelled to do things that other people are doing. When something is popular,
when we see other people doing it, we feel that it is safe to do the same thing.
This is the social proof heuristic. The more people who are doing a thing, have a belief
in something, or share an opinion, the higher the probability that we'll be drawn toward
and want to do or believe the same thing. Effectively we use the judgment of the crowd
as a substitute for our own, which reduces cognitive load, making it easier to make
decisions in complex environments.
In complex deals with wide stakeholder arrays, ultra-high performers leverage social
proof to improve win probability and lower the risk of a stalled deal and no decision. The
key is aligning stakeholder decision making and neutralizing naysayers.
Stakeholder alignment is difficult and challenging, and entails hard work. It requires:


Disciplined effort to identify and contact all stakeholders.



Gaining micro-commitments and collecting yeses from all stakeholders.



Intentional effort to build relationships with even the most hostile
stakeholders (it's harder for them to throw you under the bus when they like
you).



Communicating stakeholder agreement and consensus up, down, and
across the stakeholder array.

You cannot leave anything to chance. You need to have a level of paranoia that there is
a stakeholder you have not identified waiting in the weeds to sink your deal. You must
not assume that stakeholders are talking to each other.
In complex deals with wide stakeholder arrays, ultra-high performers become a
communication hub that connects the stakeholders. This provides the social proof that
helps stakeholders feel comfortable making a decision in favor of the UHP's proposal.
Everything UHPs do, from developing sales strategy to managing the sales process and
shaping the buying process, is all directed toward influencing the decision process.
Everything.

This is where you earn your chops. Take shortcuts here, and you'll get crushed.
However, when the sales and buying processes are aligned with the account
stakeholders' decision process, win probabilities get close to 100 percent. It becomes
almost impossible not to buy from you.

DO I LIKE YOU?
When it comes right down to it, whatever business you're in, you're in the people
business. After all, people prefer to do business with people and companies they find
likeable.
—Karen Salmansohn
At dinner this past weekend, our good friend Michelle told a story about an experience
she had while shopping for a mattress. Now, this wasn't just any mattress; this was a
high-end mattress that cost a couple of thousand dollars. Prior to hitting the stores,
she'd done extensive research online and narrowed her focus to a few brands and
styles. She found exactly what she was looking for at the first furniture store she visited,
and the price was right. But she didn't make the purchase.
Instead, she drove all the way across town to visit another furniture store where she met
sales representative Gwen. There, she purchased the same mattress she'd seen at the
other store. When I pressed her, she admitted (while avoiding eye contact with her
husband) that she paid more at the second store than the first.
“Why would you do that?” I asked.
She responded, “The guy at the first store, I think his name was Ray, just didn't impress
me. I mean, from the first moment there was just something about him I didn't like. So
even though he had the mattress I wanted, I decided to shop around some more. Gwen,
the rep at the other store, was different. Even though we'd just met I could tell she cared
about me. She made me feel good.”

No Second Chances with First Impressions
Like Michelle, we all make snap judgments when we first meet people. These
judgments, which are both imperfect and emotional, have a lasting impact on how we
view and interact with others. In Michelle's case, first impressions caused her to end up
paying more for the same product because she liked Gwen more than she liked Ray.
Your prospects make these same imperfect judgments about you.
First impressions are about likability, and likability is the gateway to building emotional
connections with stakeholders. When stakeholders like you, the probability increases
that they will be open to answering your questions and engaging in a conversation.
Unlike trust, being perceived as likable or unlikable occurs in mere moments and begins
in your stakeholders' subconscious—long before they are aware of how they feel about
you at the conscious level. Ray, the rep who turned Michelle off, is the poster child for
the saying, “You never get a second chance to make a great first impression.”
The word likable is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as having qualities that
bring about a favorable regard. We all, to some extent, have qualities and

characteristics that make us naturally likable to certain types of people and
personalities, though at the same time we possess qualities that make us naturally
unlikable to others (see the next chapter, on flexing your style).
The problem we face in sales is we don't always get to choose those with whom we
interact. Many of the people we encounter will not be naturally attracted to us.
Complicating things more are the preconceived perceptions that all people bring into
relationships. These perceptions, which include but are not limited to cultural, racial, and
socioeconomic biases, are also beyond our control.
There was just “something” about Ray that Michelle didn't like. That “something” could
be that he reminded her of a bully back in grade school, a bad date in college, or a
sales rep who broke a promise in the past. Perhaps she didn't like his facial
expressions, attitude, accent, tone of voice, tie, eye contact, or posture.
The point is, there are myriad reasons a prospect may not like you, and many of the
reasons are completely outside of your control. Therefore, when you meet new
prospects, it's critical that you control the aspects of likability that are within your power
to control.

Likability: The Gateway to Emotional Connections
Sergeant Lentz leaned through the window of the truck. His eyes darted away as he
admitted the truth. He was under heavy pressure because he'd missed his recruiting
mission two months in a row, and as he neared the end of the quarter it looked certain
that he was going to roll another zero month.
Desperate for help, he'd flagged me down after training. He explained that he'd left his
last 11 recruiting meetings without getting a commitment for a next step. “I just don't
understand it,” he said, almost pleading. “I tell them all about the National Guard and
why they should join, and then nothing. They say, ‘Thanks for the information,’ and the
conversation is over.”
“Sergeant Lentz,” I asked, “when you think back on those meetings, who is doing most
of the talking—you, the parents, or their kid?”
He took a step back from the truck and looked down at his boots. “I guess I am,” he
replied softly.

Connect
Sergeant Lentz, like so many salespeople, has a problem—a problem that is easily
fixable but nonetheless a problem. When the parents and kids to whom he's selling the
National Guard ask the question “Do I like you?” about Sergeant Lentz, the answer is
“No.”
Now don't get me wrong. Sergeant Lentz is a very likable man. He's polite, nice, and
funny, and he cares deeply about his mission to recruit young men and women into the
National Guard. What makes him unlikable is his approach.

The connecting step in the sales process is designed to win other people over by
making them feel that they are the center of your attention—to make them feel
significant or important. Your objective is to initiate and then over time nurture a deep
emotional connection. The gateway to emotional connections is likability.
Emotional connections are crucial to influencing the decisions and behaviors of
stakeholders. As these connections grow stronger, they anchor stakeholders to you and
cause your message to feel more credible to them because as they like you more and
become familiar with you, they naturally move you into their in-group.
The in-group preference, sometimes called the similarity bias, causes your stakeholders
to believe that people who are more familiar or more like them are more trustworthy,
believable, and better than people who are not. You know this to be true as surely as
you know the sun will come up in the morning, because you face and fight this bias
every day of your life.
Each of us lives and operates in a familiarity bubble. We are more comfortable with
people, places, and things inside our familiarity bubble and less comfortable with things
outside our familiarity bubble. Your ultimate goal in the sales process is to move into
your stakeholder's bubble of familiarity and in-group through an emotional connection.
Of course, we know that likability alone is not a guarantee that a stakeholder will
advocate for you or buy from you. It takes more. People buy from people they like, trust,
and believe will solve their problems. Thus, execution of the sales process and
alignment of the three processes of sales are critical to positive sales outcomes.
Likability comes first, though. Likability is the gateway to connections, familiarity, and
moving into your stakeholder's in-group. If you are not likable, you have no chance.
Stakeholders don't buy from salespeople they don't like.
Think for a moment about what makes another person likable. Likable people are nice,
polite, respectful, courteous, thoughtful, and confident; they have a positive disposition,
have an appealing outward appearance, smile (in person), have a positive, upbeat tone
of voice (phone), flex their style, and listen.
They demonstrate that they like us by giving us their sincere attention and listening. We
tend to like people who like us.
Now, think about most salespeople. Most salespeople are nice, polite, respectful, and
relatively confident; they are positive, look good, smile, and sound great on the phone.
In general, most salespeople easily pull off these likable behaviors except for one.
They talk instead of listen.

Pitch Slapping
Nobody likes a pitch. Not you, not me, not your prospects. Look at it this way. If you
could choose to hang out with people who spent the entire time you were together
talking about themselves or a person who invested the time listening to you, which
would you choose? For most people that choice is easy and obvious.

The struggle Sergeant Lentz was facing is the exact same problem thousands of
salespeople share. They show up, throw up, and are flabbergasted that their prospects
don't respond with open arms. Instead of building emotional connections, they pitch slap
stakeholders and turn them off.
Most stakeholders reluctantly give up their time to meet with you. Stakeholders are
crazy busy and not interested in meeting with mouthy salespeople, because in their
experience these meetings are a painful waste of time.
During initial meetings, stakeholders keep their emotional wall up and you at arm's
length. To bend win probability in your favor, you'll need to lower the wall.
Yet when your stakeholder is hesitant to engage, the situation is uncomfortable and
awkward. You ask questions and get clipped answers. It's like the words in the old
James Taylor song “Mexico”—you send a long letter and get back a postcard. Times
are hard.
In this emotionally uncomfortable situation, average salespeople succumb to disruptive
emotions and impatiently shift from questions to pitching, effectively killing engagement
and discovery. It's not that these salespeople are clueless. They know what to do.
They're just so overwhelmed by emotions that they don't do it. These emotions include:


Fear of the unknown: Since the salespeople don't know what the prospect
might say, they dominate the conversation to feel safe.



Attachment to control: Salespeople falsely believe that to be in control they
must be doing the talking.



Uncomfortable with silence: Whenever there is silence, the salesperson
fills in the void with words.



Impatience: The salesperson gets frustrated with the stakeholder's short
answers or slow pace and takes over the conversation.



Need for significance: The salesperson doesn't feel important when the
stakeholder is talking, so they interrupt to prove how smart they are.

Meanwhile, within this arc of disruptive emotions, the stakeholder's negativity bias is
kicking in. Their subconscious mind is homing in on and amplifying the things about you
that they don't like and magnifying the things about you that are different from them.
They don't know why, but there is something about you that “they just don't like.”
At the conscious level, a salesperson droning on and on about their company and
product features is emotionally excruciating. The stakeholder begins to consciously
seek an escape. People don't buy from people they don't like, and they don't like
salespeople who pitch slap them.
Ultra-high performers feel these same disruptive emotions. We all do. The difference is
that they are aware of how destructive the behaviors spawned by these emotions are to
stakeholder relationships. Even when the stakeholder prompts them with an “Okay, tell
me what you've got,” they resist the open invitation to pitch and instead ask questions to
get the other person talking.

Ten Keys to Being More Likable
Answering your stakeholder's question “Do I like you?” is way deeper, more complex,
and far more important than most salespeople consider. Being likable requires effort,
strategy, and intentional focus.
1. Smile. A pleasant, sincere smile is the best way to make a great first impression.
Humans are naturally attracted to other humans who are smiling. So be aware of your
facial expression, and put a smile on your face.
2. Voice tone. Like smiling, your voice tone and inflection can cause a stakeholder to
instantly like or dislike you. Your voice should be as neutral and free of regional dialects
as possible, friendly, and upbeat. Put a smile on your face and it will shine through your
voice.
3. Be polite. I saw a bumper sticker once that said, “Mean People Suck.” People who
are rude, impolite, and discourteous are unlikable. Unless you were raised in a barn by
animals, someone taught you basic manners. Put those manners to work in all
interactions with stakeholders. They will notice.
4. Dress. Despite the admonition “Don't judge a book by its cover,” people do and will
judge you based on what you wear, what you drive, and your grooming and
appearance. This judgment about whether to like you based on appearance happens in
the subconscious before your stakeholder is consciously aware of how they feel. If you
engage in face-to-face sales conversations (including video calls), dress well. Wear the
best and most professional garments you can. Ensure that they are clean and pressed,
and put you in the very best light.
5. Grooming. Look your best. Ensure that you smell good and that your cologne or
perfume is not overpowering. Ensure that your hair, facial hair, and nails are clean, cut,
clipped, and manicured. If you have tattoos, cover them up. Yes, tats are more
acceptable today than ever before; however, they can potentially turn off stakeholders
who don't consider them appropriate. No one ever said, “I didn't buy because my rep
didn't have a neck tattoo.”
6. Attention focus. In today's demanding work environment, it is easy to become
distracted. Jim Rohn said, “Wherever you are, be there.” This is essential advice when it
comes to first impressions. You must develop the self-discipline to shut everything else
out and remain completely focused on your stakeholder.
7. Style. People tend to be attracted to and more trusting of people who are like
themselves (similarity bias). Therefore, when you flex your preferred or dominant
communication style to complement that of the other person, you are more similar and
therefore more likable.
8. Language. When you speak other people's language, they readily pull you into their
in-group. Shifting your words, jargon, and approach even slightly to better match the
language of stakeholders has a big impact on likability.

9. Enthusiasm. Enthusiasm (passion) for your product, service, and company sells.
Enthusiasm is transferable and infectious. Your enthusiasm is driven by your attitude
and beliefs, so it is critical to work consistently to build and retain a winning attitude.
One note, though: there are few things more off-putting than insincere enthusiasm, so
be careful not to get carried away.
10. Confidence. Weak people repel. Arrogant people are turn-offs. Confident people
attract.

Connecting Is the Gateway to Lowering Emotional Walls and
Discovery
When people feel connected to you, they feel more comfortable revealing their real
problems. Emotional connections trump demographic differences and subconscious
biases that are beyond your control. The objective of the connect step in the sales
process is to:


Gain control of the sales conversation.



Shape (or begin the process of shaping) the buying process.



Build credibility and generate enough interest to move to the next step.



Make the buyer or stakeholder feel important.



Lower emotional walls so the stakeholder feels more comfortable sharing
information.



Open the door to discovery.

The commercial sales relationship does not begin on a footing of trust. Stakeholders are
naturally wary of salespeople and are focused on protecting their self-interest. They
bring into any new sales relationship subconscious cognitive biases, emotions, and all
the baggage—good and bad—from previous interactions with salespeople and vendors.
Your stakeholders naturally believe (negativity bias) that your intent is to extract as
much money as possible from them, and anything they say will be held against them.
Therefore, they hold their cards close to the vest.
Connecting is about minimizing the emotional roadblocks that get in the way of
transparency, honest communication, and understanding. In all relationships—business
and personal—the more connected you feel to another person, the more you are willing
to reveal your true feelings, challenges, issues, fears, wants, needs, and problems.
With most stakeholders, the layers are deep and almost impossible to reach without an
emotional connection. Unless they feel some sort of connection with you, they'll be
reticent to reveal their real problems and motivations. Salespeople who come off as
insincere and manipulative in those initial conversations tend to anchor buyers to this
state and never earn entry into the stakeholder's in-group.

One ultra-high-performance sales professional I interviewed has a rule of thumb. If she
cannot connect with her stakeholder emotionally, she will disengage and move on to
another opportunity.
She says that experience has taught her that if the person she is dealing with does not
relate to her for any reason, win probability plummets and her chances of closing the
sale are virtually zero, no matter how well her package solves problems or meets the
buyer's needs.

FLEXING TO COMPLEMENT THE FOUR PRIMARY STAKEHOLDER
PERSONAS
If it wasn't for the coffee, I'd have no identifiable personality whatsoever.
—David Letterman
You build deeper emotional connections when you interact with buyers and
stakeholders based on who they are—not who you are. Ultra-high performers (UHPs)
are masters at this. They are keenly self-aware of their behavioral style, values, and
beliefs, and they are confident enough to adjust their style to deal with people with
differing communication styles.
Stakeholders tend to like, be attracted to, and be more trusting of people who are like
them. Therefore, when you flex your preferred or dominant communication style to
complement that of the other person, that person will be more open to connecting and
answering your questions. It's easier for others to hear and understand you when you
are communicating in a style language that they understand.
We each have a unique style of dealing with the world around us. Some people are
direct, whereas others beat around the bush. Some people speak slowly and exhibit
little emotion, whereas others are more animated. People may be direct and driven,
analytical and careful, focused on building consensus, or social and outgoing.
Flexing your style essentially means adjusting your approach and interpersonal
behaviors for each individual so that they are more comfortable working with you; thus,
easing their anxiety and opening the door for an emotional connection.

Four Predominant Stakeholder Personas
There are four predominant communication styles (Figure 20.1). Labels for these styles
shift from psychometric test to psychometric test and from training program to training
program. Regardless of the labels, though, the style markers across the multiple
theories of human behavior and innate communication preferences tend to converge on
these four dominant styles.

Figure 20.1 Four Communication Styles
We use the descriptors director, analyzer, socializer/energizer, and consensus builder
because we find them easier to remember and apply.

Director (DISC Equivalent: Dominant)
Directors make decisions quickly. They have a strong bias toward action and are most
comfortable with salespeople who know how to and do get things done.
They crave control. If you want them to like you, do not compete with them. Even when
directors have given decision-making authority to another person, they'll swoop in at the
last minute and subtly exert their control by “putting their stamp on it.”
Salespeople sometimes sink deals in these situations because they pick a fight with the
director who may challenge them directly—not because the director doesn't agree with
the decision, but rather he or she wants to ensure that the sales rep knows who is boss.
The director values confidence. They steamroll insecure salespeople, without
compunction. If you don't have an answer to a question, do not try to fake it, do not
stumble over your words, and do not act weak or scared. If you do, the director will first
lose respect for you and then flatten you. Instead, confidently say you don't know but
you will get the answer, and give a specific time when you will have that answer.

Directors have no patience for long-winded pitches. When you communicate to them,
do it in bullet points and short, concise messages. Give them a little bit of information,
pause, then a little bit more, and pause.
This can be challenging for salespeople, who are often socializers, because directors
can be intimidating. Their need for speed causes you to respond in kind and speed up,
resulting in run-on sentences that bore them.
Directors will at times challenge, push, and negotiate hard, just to see if you can take it.
When you stand your ground and demonstrate confidence, while showing respect and
without challenging their authority, they will respect you.
If you waste their time, you lose them. If anything you say is not relevant to their
situation, you lose them. They care about their problems and issues and how you can
solve them.
You can build deep relationships with directors, but it is business first and socialize last.
However, when they feel that you know your stuff and can be counted on to get things
done, they will buy from you and keep buying from you.

Analyzer (DISC Equivalent: Conscientious)
As buyers, analyzers are often in the stakeholder role of deal funders and are a check
and balance to both socializers and directors, who are often deal signers. As
influencers, they're usually naysayers who pick your business case apart.
Analyzers are systematic and methodical. They reject hype and pitching and value data
and facts. They respond best to linear communication and ironclad case studies.
With analyzers, trust is built slowly. It is essential that you overprepare before every
meeting with an analyzer. Consider every question they may ask and ensure you can
answer in a cogent manner and back your answers up with facts.
Review all written documents, charts, and spreadsheets for organization and errors.
Analyzers are sticklers for accuracy. They will fixate on inaccurate information, typos, or
poorly organized data and become unable to hear anything else. To the analyzer, your
inability to answer questions, back up propositions with facts, or get it right the first time
says you are untrustworthy and eliminates you as a viable vendor.
Analyzers can often come off as cold and unengaged. Jamal, a sales rep from
Birmingham, Alabama, like many salespeople, finds dealing with analyzers emotionally
difficult.
“It's when these stakeholders freeze me out,” he says. “I ask a question and they give
me short answers. They don't show emotion and won't open up. It's frustrating and I
usually end up doing all of the talking.”
The emotional response to getting “frozen out,” to use Jamal's words, is disruptive. You
don't feel accepted, liked, or important. You get no emotional validation. So, to protect
your fragile ego, you begin pontificating—a very bad move with analyzers, as they're
masters at allowing salespeople to talk themselves out of deals.

Begin conversations by asking the analyzer about what is most important to them in the
decision-making process. Stay away from personal questions unless they bring them
up. Instead focus on business. Ask them about the process they use to judge vendors
like you. Ask them about their values.
Analyzers enter sales conversations with their emotional wall up and keep salespeople
at arm's length. The key to breaking through is methodical patience, controlling your
disruptive emotional need to be accepted, knowing your stuff, and a series of short
meetings designed to systematically build the relationship.

Socializer/Energizer (DISC Equivalent: Influential)
Socializers are easy to connect with. They're open to building relationships and value
them. In contrast to directors and analyzers, with socializers it's relationship first and
then business. They tend to communicate in long stories, are emotional and animated,
have high energy, and have a high need to feel appreciated. They like to be the center
of attention.
It's this need to feel appreciated that must not be discounted. Socializers love
compliments and flattery (as long as you are not blatantly insincere). Socializers feel
most appreciated when they're talking and you are listening. And socializers talk. A lot.
The good news about socializers is they are easy. When you listen to them, they'll buy
from you. In fact, they'll pay you to listen to them by giving you more and more
business. Their insatiable need to feel important often overrides objective, rational
decision making.
The bad news is that the socializer's need to dominate conversations can be a
challenge for salespeople who, more often than not, share this style trait. You'll feel the
disruptive desire to jump in and tell your story, too, because you also want to be the
center of attention.
Salespeople damage relationships with socializers when they compete for space in the
conversation. When working with a socializer, it's critical to keep your eye on the prize;
focus on the outcome you want rather than your need for attention.
Socializers are the opposite of analyzers. Where analyzers are linear and methodical,
the socializer is nonlinear, disorganized, and scattered. The best way to describe the
socializer is fire, ready, aim. They easily get off track and can burn a significant amount
of time during a sales meeting on nonrelated issues.
Socializers make great coaches because they enjoy connecting and sharing information
and may be leveraged to influence other stakeholders to take your side.
When working with socializers, the key is controlling the conversation with questions
that keep them talking and that guide the conversation without making them feel that
you are cutting them off. With socializers, to keep things on track, it is doubly important
that you lead off with an organized agenda and follow up with written communication on
agreed-to next steps.

Consensus Builder (DISC Equivalent: Steady)
Consensus builders value pleasing people, having ducks in a row, and safety. They
tend to be predictable, friendly, and make time to listen.
The consensus builder prefers routine and avoids risk and change. They abhor conflict
and tend to be passive-aggressive rather than direct when they have an issue with other
people. Should you offend a consensus builder, they will rarely tell you and instead will
hold a grudge and become resentful. You'll lose the deal and never know why.
Consensus builders move at a steady and often slow pace. Because they want to be
sure everyone feels included in decisions, they take great pains to involve and check
with other people. They often ask to see more—another demo, more data, additional
case studies, another presentation—earning them the nickname SeeMores.
Because consensus builders are risk averse and need all their ducks in a row before
taking action, they frustrate salespeople. Just when you believe you are on the cusp of
closing the sale, they ask for even more time or to see more information. Impatient
salespeople who push too hard shut them down. Because consensus builders are
conflict-averse, once they shut down, it is very difficult to get them to reengage.
When dealing with consensus builders, you must be very careful to slow down and earn
their trust. Ask questions to understand their sphere of influence and everyone and
anyone they want to involve in the process. It will serve you well to meet these
individuals and get them aligned.
Take time up front to gain agreement with consensus builders on exactly what they
need to see, know, and feel to make a decision in your favor. Agree on a time line and
the steps you'll need to take. Despite any agreement you've made, your consensus
builder may still get cold feet when it is time to act. Sometimes gently reminding them of
their earlier agreement and demonstrating that you've jumped through all of their hoops
is enough to get them to move forward.
Consensus builders are great listeners and masters at getting you to talk. They'll
interrogate you with questions and allow you to pitch your heart out. They make you feel
important and appreciated.
You'll walk out of meetings with consensus builders feeling awesome because you
spent so much time talking. But you'll have little else to show for the time investment
and the consensus builder, who encouraged you to talk, will feel resentful toward you
for taking up all the air in the room.
To avoid this trap, you must be acutely aware of your disruptive emotional need to tell
your story when the consensus builder asks you a question. Learn to redirect questions
with questions:
Consensus
Builder:

“Tell me how you do that.”

Salesperson:

“Could you help me understand why this is important to you?”

You'll also need to be disciplined to give short answers to their questions and follow
your answers with an open-ended question that encourages them to talk.

Style Personas Shift
Rarely do people approach the world and the environment around them with a single
dominant style. Instead, we are a composite of multiple styles with a dominant style
emerging in stressful or emotional situations and when important decisions need to be
made.
Each of these styles requires a different approach. But here is the good news. Style
doesn't matter when your mouth is shut and your ears are open.
Your mission is to reduce resistance by managing your own style. Self-awareness of
your interpersonal style is critical to becoming more effective at building connections.
Most sales training programs teach you how to approach these different styles, but few
teach you how to interpret your own style. To me, this is the real key. You must be
aware of your own dominant style if you have any hope of flexing that style to
complement others' styles. This is where you need to start.

Style Tools
Flexing to and interacting with the four stakeholder personas is complex, and to provide
a complete guide of dos and don'ts is beyond the scope of this book. We've compiled
additional training resources for flexing to different communication styles along with a
complete set of style assessments that will help you gain a better understanding of who
you are at https://www.salesgravy.com/saleseq.

SALES CALL AGENDA FRAMEWORK
The secret of your success is determined by your daily agenda.
—John C. Maxwell
Ultra-high performers (UHPs) are aware of the danger their disruptive emotions pose to
building emotional connections with stakeholders. In front of stakeholders, it's easy to:


Start pitching.



Become impatient, talk over them, and shut them down.



Inadvertently say things that trigger the stakeholder's subconscious
negativity bias and confirm their conscious perception that salespeople are
manipulative, self-centered hustlers.

The Sales Call Agenda Framework reduces the chances of making these mistakes,
especially in the early stages of a relationship. It helps you gain control of the
conversation, avoid pitching, and manage disruptive emotions. There are four steps:
1. Greeting
2. Objective
3. Check
4. Frame the conversation
The Sales Call Agenda Framework, executed correctly, disarms the stakeholder and
lowers the initial emotional wall, because you appear to be professional, prepared, and
nonthreatening.

Greeting
Your greeting is about setting the right tone, demonstrating respect, and ensuring that
you and your stakeholder agree on the time available for your meeting. Here is an
example:
“Thank you for meeting with me. I know how valuable your time is and appreciate the
opportunity you've given me to learn more about you. Just to confirm, I have us down
for thirty minutes. Is that still good for you?”
If you are meeting face-to-face, ask for permission to sit down and before placing
anything on the stakeholder's desk. If you are on the phone or a video call, ask
permission to get started. When you are sincerely polite and respectful, people tend to
respond in kind and you'll get respect in return.
Sometimes your stakeholder will be in a hurry or may respond, while looking at her
watch, “I'm sorry, I only have five minutes for you today. Quickly, tell me what you've
got.”

When this happens, be careful! Disruptive emotions will derail the conversation if you
fail to gain control.
The moment stakeholders tell you that they only have a moment and you need to hurry,
your stress and anxiety levels spike. Your fight-or-flight response kicks in and your head
spins. Time was taken away from you, and you begin focusing on what you've lost. You
may become disappointed, desperate, or angry, especially when:


You carried high expectations into the meeting.



The prospect is a big opportunity with a potentially huge payoff.



It took a massive amount of persistence to get the meeting in the first place.



The stakeholder has influence over the outcome of your deal and you feel
that they are blowing you off.



You are behind your number, pipeline is empty, and you really, really, really
need to make a sale.

In these circumstances your response may be rash. You may fight, become angry,
show emotional weakness, or push the stakeholder away with desperate whining and
begging. These behaviors make you instantly unlikable.
What is far more likely, though, is an impatient jump right into pitching.
At the very moment your fight-or-flight response kicks in, making it hard for you to think,
the stakeholder gives your insatiable need for significance permission to take center
stage.
“Tell me what you've got,” the stakeholder says.
“Whoooo-hoooo,” your brain, toasted on adrenaline, responds. “I get to be on stage and
feel important.” Without even thinking, your mouth turns on and your neocortex turns off.
Pitching fast in a time crunch almost never ends well. Your pitch flops because it is:


Generic and boring.



Not relevant to your stakeholder's unique situation.



Fast, scattered, and hard to follow because you are not behaving rationally.



Self-centered, egocentric, and arrogant.

Understand that the stakeholder's conscious good intention to give you five minutes was
driven by a subconscious feeling of obligation. It was they who agreed to the meeting
and are now reneging on that commitment. Now they owe you. They mean well.
Still the moment you start pitching, the stakeholder's subconscious is being pounded.


You are boring.



They don't feel important because you are talking.



Their negativity bias begins magnifying everything about you they don't like.



When you are talking fast, you sound manipulative, untrustworthy, and
threatening—triggering the stakeholder's fight-or-flight response.

All your stakeholder can think about is how quickly they can get you out of their face or
off the phone. Over the course of this unintended, five-minute emotional collision you
destroy the relationship and almost never set the next step.
You are on an emotional high because you've been talking. You feel important and your
confirmation bias blinds you to the evidence that your stakeholder is running fast in the
other direction. The meeting ends with a “call me maybe” promise, but it's over. The
stakeholder is not going to respond to your just-checking-in calls and e-mails.
When you get pushed into a time box by a harried stakeholder, respond with
noncomplementary behavior. Take a breath, relax, and pause. Calmly answer with a
concerned tone of voice:
“Five minutes is not nearly enough time for me to learn about you and your company.
Pitching my product without understanding your issues would be a disservice to you and
waste your time. You deserve better than that. Why don't we reschedule for Wednesday
afternoon at 2 PM?” (Notice the assumptive ask—always offer a time.)
The noncomplementary behavior and your willingness to walk away will often flip the
buyer script and pull the stakeholder toward you because it disrupts their expectations.
You'll find that a large percentage of stakeholders will shift their position at this point and
make the time for you.
If the stakeholder truly does not have time for you, the confident and assumptive ask
and the offer of a new time makes it easy for them to say yes and reschedule. The
discipline to avoid getting drawn into a pitch keeps you alive for another day.

Call Objective
Next you will define the call objective and prime your stakeholder for taking the next
step.
“What I'd like to accomplish today is to learn more about you and your organization—in
particular, how you currently manage compliance reporting. While I don't know whether
it makes sense for our companies to work together, I thought that might be the best
place to start. Then if we find common ground we can schedule a meeting with your IT
team to take a closer look at your current data management system.”
The human mind abhors the unknown. Telling your stakeholder what you want up front
sets them at ease and continues to lower the emotional wall. Additionally, you reduce
the stakeholder's cognitive load by defining a tight scope for the meeting, which makes
it easier for them to focus and engage in the conversation.
While setting the call objective, you also want to deploy a subtle take-away: “I don't
know whether it makes sense for our companies to work together.…” This serves to pull
the stakeholders attention toward you and get them engaged in two important ways:

First, it disrupts their expectation. They expect that you are going to pitch and sell to
them, because that is what salespeople do. They are not expecting a take-away—that
you'll say that it might not be a fit. This immediately pulls them in.
By indicating that you are unattached to the outcome, that you are willing to walk away if
working together might not be a fit, you activate a core human behavior in your
stakeholder—wanting what they can't have. You are saying right up front that you are
not going to chase them, in a subtle, relaxed, and nuanced way.
Everyone wants to be pursued. It makes us feel good. You are taking that away from
your stakeholder, causing them to want it even more. At the subconscious level, this
flips the script and they begin trying to win you back.
Finally, giving the targeted next step up front prepares them for change and primes
them to say yes when asked for the next step at the end of your call.
Priming is a powerful technique used to train a stakeholder's subconscious memory. 1
Priming increases the probability that a stakeholder will comply with a future request.
There are multiple ways to prime the human brain, ranging from repetition to images
and experiences. For example, were I to show you a picture of food and then ask you to
fill in the blank in SO__P, you'd most likely fill in U for SOUP. I primed your answer by
injecting an associated idea into your memory.
Showing a subject the color or word red, for example, increases the probability that they
think of apple rather than banana when you ask them to think of a fruit. Priming the
association with red created an artificial heuristic that made it easier for the brain to
come up with apple. When you give people a point of reference, they tend to think in
that direction.
In the case of our stakeholders, we prime their propensity to say yes to a next step by
injecting the idea of and expectation for a next step into their memory early in the sales
conversation.

Check Your Stakeholder's Agenda
It is respectful and good manners to check your stakeholder's agenda. It makes them
feel important and appreciated and creates a sense of ownership. People are more
invested when they feel included and that their opinion matters.
“Before we get started, is there anything else you want to be sure we cover?”
Ninety percent of the time when you ask this question, stakeholders will say, “I'm good.”
They agree to go down the path toward the next step that you have defined. Once they
agree, they'll tend to remain consistent with that agreement and move toward the next
step for which they were primed.
In rare circumstances, though, they'll throw something on the table. They may respond
with a legitimate issue to add to the agenda. They may throw out a red herring 2 or direct
challenge.

With their issue, challenge, or redirection on the table, the very next move you make will
determine whether you engage the stakeholder and get a next step or lose control.
It is at this moment of truth that you must wrest control of your disruptive emotions and
patiently acknowledge the issue or concern, add it to the agenda, and keep moving.
You should not, however, address or engage in a conversation about the issue or
concern at that point.
Salespeople who succumb to their disruptive emotions, pounce on whatever the
stakeholder says and begin pitching, defending their position, negotiating, or
overcoming the concern as if it were an objection to buying. In doing so they derail the
conversation.
Average
salesperson:

“Before we get started, is there anything else you want to be sure we cover?”

Stakeholder:

“The last time we used your company we had a terrible experience with your customer service. If you can't do a better
job, there is no way we can buy from you again!”

Average
salesperson:

“I don't know what went wrong last time, but our customer satisfaction rating is 96 percent, the highest in our industry.

Stakeholder:

“Yeah, that's the same thing your rep said last time. But it was all a lie. Your drivers didn't show up on time. Your product

This is driven by our Five-Star customer service process that guarantees your satisfaction.”

quality was shoddy. And when we called customer service nobody ever got back to us. That's why I changed to your
competitor. The only reason I let you back in here is because you told me you could beat their price.”

Average
salesperson:

“All my customers are very happy with the service we give them. I assure you that you will be, too. Our product was just

Stakeholder:

“Look, I'm not going to sit here and argue with you about the truth. Your product quality was terrible and your service

rated highest quality in our industry, so your experience wasn't indicative of other customers.”

even worse. Why don't you just e-mail me your prices, and if they are as low as you say maybe we'll keep talking.”

Meeting over. Win probability zero. You can't argue stakeholders into believing that they
are wrong.

Psychological Reactance
People have a predictable tendency to rebel when they are told that something is
forbidden, a freedom is taken away, or that they are wrong. This behavior, called
psychological reactance,3 unleashes your inner brat. When someone forbids you or tells
you that you're wrong, your response is quick and emotional: “Oh yeah? I'll show you!”
This is the reason you cannot argue other people into believing they are wrong. No
matter the logic of your argument, data, or supporting facts, the other person will dig
their heels in and rebel.

Psychological reactance can be leveraged with stakeholders by helping them see that
your competitor is “handcuffing them” or “taking away their options.” Or you may be able
to demonstrate how a specific course of action could “restrict their options” or “take
away their peace of mind.”
Notice my use of words. Message matters. The more vivid a picture 4 you can paint for
your stakeholders of a potential restriction or loss of options, the greater the activation
of their rebellion. Use stories that illustrate the consequences of the restriction,
especially stories of other customers who have “broken out of these handcuffs” and
“regained their freedom and options.”
What you must not ignore, though, is how the wrong words can turn a stakeholder
against you. This can be a problem for salespeople who bring sales engineers and
subject matter experts to sales calls and demos. These individuals tend to use words
like must and need to. They use black-and-white language and warnings, rather than
giving impartial and objective information, and allowing stakeholders to come to their
own conclusions.5
People do not like to be told what they can't do. When your words come off as
controlling or dogmatic, it can trigger reactance, pushing your stakeholder away from
you.
Take time before meetings and in pre-call planning to coach and prepare your team and
yourself to avoid words and phrases that may trigger reactance. Anticipate and role-play
how to answer difficult questions without putting the stakeholder in a corner. Avoid
saying “no” and instead allude to choices and options with phrases like “the choice is up
to you,” or “we can explore options.”

Gain Control
I can't begin to tell you how many salespeople I've watched jump right into a price
negotiation in the agenda stage of the sales call just because the person on the other
side of the table said: “The one thing that I need you to understand is we're going to
need your very best prices.” It's always a train wreck.
Ultra-high performers absorb whatever their buyer or stakeholder says. If it is a
legitimate question, they write it down and add it to the agenda. “That's a great question,
and I'll make sure to answer it during our conversation.”
UHPs are patient. They know that what seem like early objections usually go away and
never come back once their prospect starts talking and a connection is made. UHPs
recognize that these early challenges and objections are just part of the buyer script and
are often mechanisms stakeholders use to protect themselves from what they perceive
to be manipulative salespeople.
When ultra-high performers get a direct challenge from a prospect that revs up the old
fight-or-flight response, they are disciplined to manage their emotions and response.
Because stakeholders respond in kind, instead of becoming defensive, argumentative,
or angry, UHPs leverage noncomplementary behavior to flip the script. They respond in
a relaxed, calm tone, acknowledge the issue, and take control of the conversation.

UHP:

“Before we get started, is there anything else you want to be sure we cover?”

Stakeholder “The last time we used your company we had a terrible experience with your customer service. If you can't do a better job,
there is no way we can buy from you again!”
:
UHP:

“Gosh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I tell you what. If it's okay with you, why don't we start off with a few questions that will allow
me to learn more about you and your unique demands and requirements? Then I can show you some of the many positive
changes we've made since the last time we worked together. From there we can decide if it makes sense for both of us to
move to the next step.”

Stakeholder “Okay.”
:
UHP:

“I'm curious—I read that you guys picked up a huge new contract with McKenzie. How is that impacting the rest of the
business?”

My rule of thumb with an early objection is to ignore it and not talk about it again unless
my stakeholder brings it back up. Average salespeople collect these ghost objections
like coins and in moments of insecurity remind stakeholders of objections that had
already been forgotten.

Frame the Conversation
As you move into the sales conversation, the temptation to pitch is strong and, even
though stakeholders are repelled by sales pitches, they will allow you—and sometimes
encourage you (“Tell me what you've got”)—to unload your entire inventory of features
and benefits.
By framing the conversation structure, you send a direct signal to your emotional brain
to shut up, and position your rational brain (neocortex) to take control of your disruptive
desire to talk.
Framing the conversation is simple and sounds like this:
“If it's okay with you, why don't we start off with a few questions that will help me learn
more about you and your unique situation? Then we can talk a little bit about our
service. From there we can decide together if it makes sense to move to the next step.”
The rubber meets the road at this frame. It is a critical inflection point. Managed well,
you will gain control of the call, get the stakeholder talking, and move to the next step.
Handled poorly, you'll start pitching and your call and relationship will go nowhere. The
Sales Conversation Framework has three steps:
1. Stakeholder talks. The more your stakeholders talk about themselves, the
more emotionally connected they feel to you, opening the door for you to
gather the information you need to qualify win probability and build the case
for moving to the next step.

2. You bridge. After listening to and learning the stakeholder's unique situation,
problems, pain, needs, or opportunities, you'll have your opportunity to talk.
However, rather than a generic pitch, you should shape your story so that it
bridges or connects the dots between the stakeholder's unique situation and
your product or service—just enough to build credibility and make the case
for moving to the next step.
3. Ask for the next step. Confidently asking for the next step (microcommitment) is part of the natural flow of the conversation. “Based on
everything we've discussed today, my recommendation is we meet with your
IT team to do a demo of our new dashboard.” Your prospect is already
primed to take that next step, so the probability that you get a yes is high.
None of this will happen, though, if you lead off with a pitch. As soon as you start
talking, you lose them.
The key to getting the stakeholder talking is opening the conversation with a broad,
open-ended question that is easy for them to answer and that they'll enjoy answering. In
doing so you slowly break down emotional barriers and build a connection. It's here that
you begin the process of triggering the stakeholder's self-disclosure loop (we'll discuss
this in more detail in the next chapter).
When you use this framework or a similar set of words in each sales meeting, you train
your rational brain to turn your mouth off. Practiced enough, it will become an ingrained
habit.

Emotional Contagion: People Respond in Kind
One of the truths about human behavior is that people tend to respond in kind. “People
are extremely good at picking up on other people's emotions—both negative and
positive—without consciously trying,” writes Shirley Wang in her article “Contagious
Behavior.”6
Dr. Elaine Hatfield discovered that emotional contagion, a subconscious response to the
emotions of other people, makes it very easy to both feel what another person is feeling
and transfer emotions to stakeholders.7
Emotional contagion is primarily an automatic subconscious response that causes
humans to mirror or mimic the behaviors and emotions of those around them. Knowing
how to leverage emotional contagion is a powerful meta-skill for influencing human
behavior.
Let's begin with empathy. One of the surprising findings from Hatfield's work is our
innate ability to feel what other people are feeling, and shift our behaviors to align with
those new feelings. When you are relaxed and confident, for instance, you transfer that
emotion to your stakeholders. Should you want stakeholders to be enthusiastic about
meeting you, be enthusiastic about meeting them.

A relaxed, confident, positive demeanor sets the right tone for meetings. Because
people respond in kind, it helps you gain control of the conversation. It's important to
note, however, that emotional contagion (responding in kind) goes both ways.
I've spent most of my life around horses. Horses have an innate ability to sense fear.
They test new riders and take advantage of those riders the moment they sense that the
person is afraid or lacks confidence. Horses have a 10-to-1 weight and size advantage
over the average person. If the horse doesn't believe that you are in charge, it can and
will dump you.
Stakeholders are no different. If they sense fear, weakness, defensiveness, or lack of
confidence, they will shut you down or bulldoze right over you. For this reason, when
horses or people challenge you, no matter the emotions you are feeling, you must
respond with a noncomplementary behavior—a behavior that counters and disrupts
their aggression. This requires relaxed confidence.

Confidence and Enthusiasm
Confidence and enthusiasm (passion) are the two most persuasive nonverbal
messages. Disruptive emotions kill confidence and enthusiasm. When likability is on the
line, a failure to regulate disruptive emotions can cause you to transfer negative
emotions to your stakeholders. When you lack confidence in yourself, they'll tend to lack
confidence and thus trust in you. Perhaps you:


Are new and feel insecure about your product or industry knowledge.



Have a depleted pipeline, are under the gun to close something, and feel
desperate.



Are meeting with a C-level executive and feel intimidated.



Had a sales meeting turn into a train wreck and fear this will happen again.

For this reason, you must develop and practice techniques for building and
demonstrating relaxed confidence and purposeful enthusiasm even when you feel the
opposite. This begins with managing your nonverbal communication to control what the
stakeholder sees or hears when dealing with you, including:


Voice tone, inflection, pitch, and speed.



Body language and facial expressions.



Sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and the words used in written
communication—e-mail, text messaging, and social messaging.



The way you dress and your outward appearance.

Getting past the emotions that disrupt confidence and enthusiasm is among the most
formidable challenges for sales professionals. I've been selling my entire life and have
been incredibly successful at it, yet today I still catch myself feeling intimidated when
meeting with top executives, lacking confidence after experiencing a loss or failure, or
coming up short on enthusiasm when I'm worn out and not feeling my best.

I must remind myself that my emotions influence my stakeholder's emotions. I often
repeat Eleanor Roosevelt's admonition: “No one can make you feel inferior without your
consent.” Then take intentional steps to ensure that outwardly, even if I must fake it, I
appear relaxed, poised, confident, and enthusiastic.
This brings us back to the emotional intelligence trait of self-awareness. Even in
emotionally draining situations, you must maintain the discipline to be aware of your
emotions and how those emotions may be affecting other people.
As we learned earlier, self-awareness and self-control are like muscles. The more you
exercise them, the stronger they get.

DO YOU LISTEN TO ME?
As soon as you start pitching your ears turn off and so does your buyer.
—Jeb Blount
Think about a time when you were trying to explain something to another person. Recall
the moment, right in the middle of your story, that the other person held up a hand and
said, “Stop! Could you just get to the point?” Consider how that made you feel—hurt,
unappreciated, angry, enraged? Left with the feeling that the other person did not
understand you?
How about the time you were trying to have a conversation with friends or family
members and they kept looking down at their phones at incoming text messages or
social media alerts. Remember how it made you want to rip the phones from their hands
and smash them on the floor!
Have you ever been excited to tell your significant other about your day? You talked, but
the person wasn't paying attention because he or she was watching TV, playing a video
game, or typing away on a computer laptop?
“You're not even listening to me!” you complained in disgust. “I don't know why I even
bother!” As your significant other replied with a “Huh?” while barely averting attention
from the screen, did you feel more emotionally connected or in love with him or her in
that moment?
You know the truth and so do I. When people don't listen to you, it makes you feel small,
unappreciated, and unimportant. It damages emotional connections. Failure to listen is
a direct route to a destroyed relationship.

Why People Don't Listen
Nothing builds emotional connections faster and more permanently than listening. You
know this because every book on sales, in one form or another, admonishes that
listening is the key to real success. You know this because a listening module is
contained in every sales training.
You know this because you are human. You know this because people are not listening
to you, and it hurts.
If there is any good news, it's that you are not alone. It turns out that feeling this way is
the human condition. It seems nobody is listening to anybody. Everyone is frustrated.
We all want to be heard. We all scream out, “Will somebody just listen to me?!”
The number-one complaint stakeholders have about sellers is that sellers don't listen.
And the stakeholders are right. Salespeople don't listen. It's epidemic.
Despite all that we have been taught and all that we know, listening is still the weakest
link in human interaction. The reason we don't listen is listening requires empathy,

cognitive focus, and effort to manage our self-centered, disruptive emotions. It's a
challenge to:


Tune out the distracting noise from the world around you.



Be patient and wait for your turn to talk.



Avoid looking down at your phone screen.



Turn off your thoughts and pay attention to another person.



Remain interested when you find the other person boring.



Bite your tongue when you feel the urge to interrupt so you can tell your story
or prove how much you know.

The fact is, you spend 95 percent of your time thinking and talking about yourself—
including your product or service. The other 5 percent of your time you're dealing with
things, including mouthy stakeholders, who are keeping you from thinking about you.
Whether due to boredom or to the inability to remove distractions, it's just so much
easier to turn your attention to your own selfish needs and wants.
Telling your story makes you feel important. Listening to another person's story does
not. The disruptive emotional need for significance is the primary reason why
salespeople talk and do not listen.

Four Principles of Effective Sales Conversations
Anne Morrow Lindbergh wrote that “good communication is as stimulating as black
coffee and just as hard to sleep after.” Great sales conversations should be engaging,
thought provoking, and memorable.
There are four principles to effective and engaging sales conversations. This four-part
framework allows you to control the conversation and move toward your outcome, while
building deeper emotional connections with stakeholders.
1. People respond in kind.
2. People communicate in stories.
3. Questions control the conversation flow.
4. Listening builds deep emotional connections.

People Respond in Kind
Look around you. Do you notice how few people are smiling? Now try this experiment.
When they look up at you, smile at them. I've found that, nine times out of 10, they'll
smile right back. For a moment you have an instant connection.
As you've learned, when you are relaxed, confident, and patient, you'll transfer those
emotions to your stakeholders, they'll respond in kind, and you'll gain control of the
conversation.

People Communicate in Stories
In conversations, people don't spit out bullet-pointed facts. Instead, they use stories.
You tell stories, I tell stories, and your stakeholders tell stories. It's human. It's how we
communicate. We tell stories to be understood. We want to be understood. We crave to
be understood. And, when we are onstage telling our story, we feel important.
When you listen attentively, you encourage stakeholders to expand on and tell more
stories. The clues that lead to their real problems and emotions are buried inside these
stories.
But consider your emotional state when another person is telling you their story. Your
mind drifts. You feel the urge to jump in and add your two cents. You don't feel
important.
Stakeholders communicate in stories to be understood, but the truth is that you prefer
that they communicate in bullet points. You want to speed them up and get them to the
point, so you can get back to telling your own story.
Resist this disruptive emotion. The stakeholder wants to talk, sometimes at you. Don't
get in the way. Inside the stakeholder's story is the information you need to build the
case for how you, and only you, can solve their unique problem.

Questions Control the Conversation Flow
Most salespeople believe that to be in control of a conversation they must be doing all
the talking. I assure you it is the other way around. It is the person asking the questions
who has control.
When you are asking questions, you control the shape of the conversation and move it
in any direction you please. This helps you keep the conversation on track and focused
on your call objective, while making your stakeholder feel listened to and important.
Remember this: stakeholders communicate in stories, but they don't care which story
they are telling as long as they're getting to tell their story.

Listening Builds Deep Emotional Connections
The more you listen, the more connected your stakeholder feels to you. As this
connection deepens, their trust in you grows and emotional walls crumble. As the walls
come down, you'll get far below the surface and gain access to your stakeholder's real
problems.
It is here that ultra-high performers (UHPs) derive their competitive edge and begin to
build a wide separation from the pack. Stakeholders never complain about salespeople
who listen.

The Fine Art of Listening
The discipline to control your disruptive emotions and listen requires you to have faith
that when you are listening you are in control and by listening you connect and win
others over. The secret to influence is not what you say; it's what you hear.
There is absolutely nothing more important in the sales process than listening. Nothing!
Listening is the key to connecting, making stakeholders feel important, discovery,
bridging, getting to next steps, and closing. Ultra-high performance depends on it, and
most salespeople suck at it.
You've developed the habit of being self-absorbed over the course of a lifetime, and it is
the hardest habit you will ever break. To turn everything in your head off, become
genuinely interested in another person, give them your undivided attention, and hear
them—learning to really listen—requires a fundamental mind-set shift.
Begin with empathy. Consider how you feel when people are not listening to you, and
remember that pain. Step into your stakeholders' shoes and consider how they feel
when you dominate the conversation or demonstrate through your actions that you're
not listening.
Focus on what you really want. A closed deal, higher income, respect, deeper
relationships, high performance, deeper information, a next step, an advocate or coach,
a friend—focus on and leverage what you really want as motivation to regulate your
disruptive emotions of boredom, attention control, and the need for significance. Believe
and have faith that when you listen you build stronger emotional connections that lead
to the outcomes you seek.
Practice attention control. Focusing completely on the person in front of you and
being genuinely interested is an intentional behavior. Make a deliberate choice to
remove all other distractions, including your own self-centered thoughts and impulse to
interrupt, and give the stakeholder your complete attention.
Be intentional. Before each meeting, prepare yourself mentally to listen. During the
meeting, tell yourself to shut up and listen—make it a conscious, intentional choice. Be
aware of your urge to blurt out your idea when you feel the impulse to make a point, and
stop yourself. After each conversation, evaluate how well you paid attention,
acknowledge your shortcomings, and adjust.

Active Listening
Active listening is essentially a set of behaviors that provide tangible proof that you are
listening. These behaviors include eye contact, acknowledging with verbal feedback and
body language, summarizing and restating what you have heard, and utilizing pauses
and silence before speaking.
Active listening rewards your stakeholder for talking and keeps them talking. This is
important because the more they talk, the more they'll reveal about their situation.

Summarizing, restating, and asking relevant follow-up questions that build on the
conversation validate that you are paying attention. Nodding your head, smiling in
approval, and leaning forward when you find something they say particularly interesting
demonstrate that you are engaged. Supporting phrases like “Yes, I see,” “That makes
sense,” and “That's exciting” encourage them to open up and reveal more.
One sure way to kill a conversation is to blurt out your next question or statement or,
worse, talk over a stakeholder before they have finished speaking. It becomes
transparent that you are not listening with the intent to understand, but rather to
formulate the next thing you plan to say.
When you feel that the other person has finished speaking, pause and count to three.
This affords you time to fully digest what you have heard, before responding. More
important, it leaves room for others to finish speaking and prevents you from cutting
them off if they have not. You'll often find that this moment of silence triggers
stakeholders to reveal important information they were holding back.
Active listening requires that you be present in the conversation. Turn the sound off on
devices so that beeps, dings, and buzzes don't cause you to look away.
The moment you make the mistake of looking away, not only will you lose
concentration, but you'll also offend the other person. This is especially acute on video
calls because the stakeholder has no insight into your surrounding environment and will
usually assume the worst—that you are not interested in them.
When meeting face-to-face, maintain eye contact. When on the phone, keep your eyes
off papers and screens so as to avoid the burning desire to multitask. Controlling your
eyes keeps you there physically, even when you are on the phone. As go your eyes, so
goes your attention.

Listen Deeply
People communicate with far more than words. To truly hear another person, you must
listen with all your senses—eyes, ears, and intuition. Opening your senses to become
aware of the entire message affords you the opportunity to analyze the emotional
nuances of the conversation.
As you listen, observe your stakeholder's body language and facial expression. You
don't need to be an expert in body language to see obvious clues. You only need to be
observant and tune in to the emotional nuances.
Pay attention to the tone, timbre, and pace of the stakeholder's voice. Focus on the
meaning behind the words they are using. Be alert for emotional cues, verbal and
nonverbal. Since people tend to communicate in stories, listen deeply to pick up unsaid
feelings and emotions.
When the stakeholder expresses emotion through facial expressions, body language,
tone, or words, you gain insight into what is important to them. As you perceive

emotional importance, ask follow-up questions to test your hunch, like “That sounds
pretty important. How are you dealing with it?”
This opens the door for relevant follow-up questions that encourage your stakeholder to
expound on the issues that are most important to them—a key to triggering the selfdisclosure loop and getting below their emotional surface.

Activating the Self-Disclosure Loop
Harvard researchers Jason Mitchell and Diana Tamir discovered that humans get a
neurochemical buzz from self-disclosure.1
In this fascinating study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences,2 subjects were given the opportunity to talk or brag about themselves while
their brain activity was being observed on high-powered 3-D magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scans.
As the subjects began talking about themselves, even about mundane information, the
area of the brain associated with pleasurable feeling and reward like good food, sex,
and cocaine became activated. Each time the subject would self-disclose, this area of
the brain would light up like a Christmas tree.
The subjects were getting a shot of dopamine (brain crack) for revealing something
about themselves. And thus a loop was formed. Each reveal of personal information,
each brag, each opinion was rewarded with another shot of dopamine, thus
perpetuating more self-disclosure. This is how conversations can quickly escalate from
small talk to too much information (TMI).
You've witnessed this dopamine triggered self-disclosure loop at parties or family
reunions or even when talking to a stranger at a bar. The other person tells you a little
bit about themselves and you listen. Then they tell a little bit more and a little bit more,
until suddenly they cross into the TMI zone and you're left wondering why in the world
they told you something so personal or revealing.
To them, the self-reveal felt great. Even though they knew, at the conscious level, that
they should not say the things they told you, they couldn't help it. It was the brain crack
talking.
For sales professionals, understanding and leveraging this reward loop can prove a
boon for discovery. Staying out of the way and allowing your stakeholders to talk
triggers self-disclosure, flips the buyer script, and causes them to spill the beans.
Chris Keiley recently closed a big deal after a stakeholder hit him with a hard objection
about his high prices.
“I gave no reaction to her pushback and instead asked her about her current vendor.
She went on for a half hour about the problems she was having with them and their
poor service. In the past, I would have tried to interject or overcome the objection, but
after learning about brain crack, I just let her talk. When she finished revealing every
reason why she should be doing business with me, she asked why she should pay

more with my company. I simply responded that we don't treat our customers that way.
She signed the contract without any more argument.”
This simple neurochemical reward system allows you to leave linear interrogative
questioning behind. Instead of dozens of questions, you ask just a few questions and
still get a huge amount of information. Kurt Long, CEO of FairWarning, says his goal is
to “see how much information I can extract with the fewest questions.”

To activate the self-disclosure loop:
1. Begin with an easy opening question that your stakeholder will enjoy
answering.
2. Reward the stakeholder for talking through active listening and sincere
interest.
3. Avoid interrupting, rushing, or talking over the stakeholder.
4. Pause three to five seconds before speaking. Allow the stakeholder to fill in
the silence. (If you start talking you'll break the loop.)
5. Once the loop is running and the stakeholder begins to self-disclose, center
your follow-up questions on those self-disclosures (deep listening), and you'll
gain complete control of the conversation, move past the buyer script, and
uncover the stakeholder's real pain, needs, issues, and problems.
Activating the self-disclosure loop relies on the dual process discovery methodology
(we'll discuss this in the next chapter). Your questions must be in the moment,
conversational, relevant, built upon the conversation, and centered on emotion.

DISCOVERY
SALES IS A LANGUAGE OF QUESTIONS
The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance—it is the illusion of knowledge.
—Daniel J. Boorstin
Dead on arrival. I'd driven four hours for the sales meeting and been shut down in the
first 15 minutes. “We're happy with the vendor we're working with now, but if you want to
sharpen your pencil and give us your best prices, we'll take that into consideration.”
Chuck, the decision maker, put a quick end to our conversation.
It was a huge account—so big that signing it would punch my ticket to the annual
President's Club trip to Maui. In my territory, you got only two or three shots a year at
deals this big because there just weren't that many of them. That's why every one of my
competitors was courting Chuck's deal, too.
The biggest obstacle to closing this deal, though, was not the circling sharks; it was the
incumbent vendor, a local company that had been serving the account for more than 20
years. There was no way they were letting anyone steal this highly profitable diamond
from them, and thus far they had been successful at fending off competitors and getting
a renewal at each contract period.
In my industry, customers signed exclusive contracts, typically for five years. Losing a
deal meant being locked out for years at a time. This meant that I had one shot at the
deal; there would be no second chance. The clock was ticking.
Chuck was the Vice President of HR at a massive bakery nestled in the foothills of the
Appalachians in western North Carolina. Although he was required to put his people in
uniforms for health and safety reasons, to him uniforms were little more than a
commodity, on the level of mundane supplies like toilet paper.
He was well versed in how rental uniform contracts worked and had his buyer script
down. He quickly gave me all the facts.


This is how many people we have in uniform.



Here are our garment specs by department.



This is what we purchase directly.



This is what we rent.



Here are the numbers on mats and towels.



We're not having any issues; our current vendor does a good job and is
responsive to our needs.



Looking forward to seeing your proposal. I'm happy to consider it. Make sure
you give us your best prices.

Discovery over. DOA. Four-hour drive home to lick my wounds. Win probability = zero.
I thanked him for the information and his time and promised to “put something together.”
Then I used a tactic that had worked in other situations like this.
I said, “Chuck, you know I've always wanted to see how a bakery works. Since I drove
four hours to get here, I'm wondering—would you be willing to take me on a tour?”
There was no hesitation. He said, “Sure, come on.”

The Tour
As soon as we walked out of his office, Chuck's entire demeanor changed—an
emotional shift that often occurs when the barrier of the desk and the power center of
the office are removed and you begin walking side by side with a stakeholder.
At the subconscious level your stakeholder's brain moves you from adversary (caution)
to student (safe). At the same time, stakeholders begin to feel emotionally significant
because they have the opportunity to tell their story, brag, and show off—triggering the
self-disclosure loop.
Sitting across the desk from a prospect is one-dimensional, whereas walking through a
facility is three-dimensional. You see things, intuit things, and discuss things that you'd
never experience in an across-the-desk conversation. This tactic is unavailable to inside
sales reps, but for field sales professionals, a facility tour, when it makes sense, is a
powerful tool for building emotional connections and complete 360-degree discovery.
Chuck started our tour on the loading dock. He showed me how the freshly baked bread
was loaded onto the trucks, expressing pride in their new “green” fleet. Then we walked
to the other side of the dock to where the raw ingredients were unloaded. He explained
that the plant never shut down and they received thousands of pounds of flour around
the clock.
From there we moved to the mixing floor where the dough was made. I learned about
yeast and how bread rises. We then moved on to the ovens and watched as the bread
cooled and went on conveyor belts to the packaging room. The packaging machines
were my favorite part of the tour—the people who invent those things are geniuses.
Finally, we walked into the quality control room. There the bread was inspected by a
group of serious-looking men and women who eyeballed every loaf before the bread
passed through a strange-looking arch on the way to shipping.
“Chuck, what's that for?” I pointed at the arch and the strip of red lights embedded in it.
“That's the metal detector.” Chuck's voice took on a somber tone. “Every loaf passes
through a metal detector. You can imagine how bad it would be for us if someone
purchased our bread at their local grocery store, made a sandwich, and then broke a
tooth on a piece of metal that had inadvertently fallen into the dough. The store would
get sued, we'd get sued, and the PR would be very bad for business.”
I nodded gravely. “That would be bad.”

With the tour over, we headed back toward Chuck's office. On our way, I asked if we
could go back over to the mixing room because there was one more thing I wanted to
see. Chuck said, “Sure,” and we walked over.
Earlier he'd introduced me to Betty, a lady who had worked at the bakery for 40 years.
When we arrived back at the mixing room, I caught her attention. “Hey, Betty, got a
minute?” Betty smiled and walked over to Chuck and me.
“Betty, I know this is a weird question, but I'm just curious. What kind of buttons are
those on your shirt?”
Betty looked down at her shirt and thought about it for a moment. Then she looked back
up and said, “Well, if I'm not mistaken, those are plastic buttons.”
I didn't say anything, giving Betty's answer time to sink in. Finally, I saw it register on
Chuck's face. Plastic buttons don't get caught by metal detectors.
Metal detectors are required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to be in food
service plants.1 Along with metal detectors are regulations that require garments worn in
food service plants to have metal snaps rather than plastic buttons, hidden under a
closed placket just for an extra measure of safety.
The people in Chuck's plant were wearing the wrong uniforms, and this was putting him
and his company at risk. His current vendor—the one he thought was doing a good job
—had failed him. But because I asked the right question, I didn't have to say it. He
became aware of this on his own terms, which is a far more effective means of
challenging status quo than an attempt to argue him into believing he is wrong.
In sales, a question you ask is far more powerful than anything you'll ever say.

Alpha and Omega
Multiple-choice test. If I were to write and publish an article, which article do you predict
would get the most views—a or b?
a. Discovery and asking questions
b. Closing and overcoming objections
If you chose the article on closing and objections you'd be correct. We've run the
experiment enough times to gauge what the sales audience likes to read. Closing and
dealing with objections is sexy. Salespeople yawn at articles about questioning.
But the sales audience is dead wrong. The magic in sales does not happen at the close.
It happens in discovery.
It's time for a mind-set shift. Discovery is the heart and soul of sales. The reason so
many salespeople struggle with closing and objections is they skip or take short-cuts
with discovery.
Ultra-high performers (UHPs) close many deals during discovery. Not because there is
a conscious decision to buy in that moment. Rather, a well-placed question creates

doubt about a current vendor, process, or belief, or, provokes a stakeholder to consider
the risk of failing to act.
Average salespeople tend to believe that challenging the status quo is about telling
stakeholders that they are doing things wrong, teaching them about what they should be
doing, or pushing insight down their throats. It mostly comes off as arrogant
pontificating.
Ultra-high performers leverage a language of questions to uncover needs, problems,
pain, and opportunities; to provoke self-awareness; and to challenge the status quo.
Because stakeholders act for their reasons, not yours, anything you might tell them
about their business or problems is 10 times more powerful when delivered in the form
of a question.
In sales, questions are the beginning and the end. Alpha and omega. If sales were a
language, it would be a language of questions—strategic, artful, and fluid questions
asked in the context of a conversation.

Joe the Interrogator
If you've ever had a chance to see an iceberg up close, you know they are huge. What
is hard to fathom, though, is that what you see of the iceberg is only a small portion of
the total mass, most of which is hidden below the water's surface.
It is this hidden mass that poses the greatest danger. On ships that sail in seas where
icebergs float, failure to heed the danger posed by the hidden mass of icebergs leads to
disastrous and fatal consequences.
Stakeholders are much like icebergs, revealing only surface information while keeping
their real problems and emotions hidden from view. Until you get beneath the surface,
you have no way of knowing if you are addressing their most important and emotional
issues.
Consider Joe, an account executive, who walks into the office of a new prospect,
introduces himself, and begins pitching his company and products. After his initial pitch
(as taught in his company's sales training), he transitions into interrogating Linda, the
buyer:
Are you happy with your current supplier?
What product specs do you need?
Are you having issues with delivery?
What do you do when a shipment is poor quality?
How often do you order?
How much do you order?
How much are you paying per unit?
Are you the decision maker on this product?

Faced with Joe's questioning onslaught, Linda raises her emotional wall and sticks to
her buyer script, responding with just the facts.
Yes, they do a good job, but we are always open to other quotes.
Here is a spec sheet of what we are using now.
Not really; like I said, they do a good job.
We don't have issues, but if we did we would ask them to replace the defective units.
Monthly.
From 20,000 to 75,000 units, depending on demand.
We don't share that information. But I'm happy to look at a competitive quote.
Yes. I make the final decision.
As the conversation hits an awkward pause, Joe swings into a pitch for his “higherquality” product. Bored, Linda hurries him up. She looks at her watch. “Joe, I've got
another meeting to get to. Why don't you e-mail your prices and specs over to me and
we'll talk again in a couple of weeks?”
Joe dashes back to his office and grabs his sales manager. “I've got a great opportunity
over at XTech Industries. I'm talking to the decision maker and she's super interested!
But I need to get aggressive on our pricing to get this one.”
Joe talks his sales manager into approving rock-bottom prices and shoots his quote
over to Linda that afternoon. He puts the deal into his forecast.
Three days later, Joe, anticipating an easy close, calls Linda back. He gets voice mail.
Then he sends an e-mail. Days go by and then weeks. He calls and calls but gets no
response. He promises his anxious sales manager that the deal will close soon, and the
forecast will be okay.
Finally, he gets Linda on the phone. After a quick exchange of pleasantries, Linda
explains that she's decided to go with one of Joe's competitors instead. Joe feels the
blood drain from his head. Stunned and lightheaded, he manages to stammer a weak
“Why?”
Linda explains that the other vendor had a better solution to her most pressing problem
—a problem that Joe knew nothing about. Joe stammers back, “You didn't say anything
about that issue. I wish I had known. We have the best solution on the market for that
problem. Will you please reconsider? I can be back over there in an hour!”
But it is too late. The decision has been made. Why didn't Joe know about this problem?
Imagine the scene from a movie. The villain is strapped to a chair in the middle of an
empty room. A bright light is pointed into his eyes while the interrogator peppers him
with accusatory, leading, closed-ended questions. The interrogator intends to make the
villain feel as uncomfortable as possible and push him off-balance, breaking him down
so that in a moment of weakness he reveals his deepest secrets.

Many salespeople, like Joe, unknowingly put stakeholders in a similar uncomfortable
position. They unload an avalanche of closed-ended, and often leading, questions that
may come off as imposing, self-serving, and manipulative. In response, stakeholders
deflect, obfuscate, and erect emotional barriers.
The stakeholders who've endured these interrogations before are prepared with pat
answers and a rote buyer script. Held at bay, interrogators like Joe only scrape the
surface, learning little about the stakeholder's real problems, and in the process, shatter
emotional connections.
On the contrary, artfully structured, open-ended questions asked in the context of a fluid
conversation keep stakeholders engaged. Sales is a conversation, not an interrogation.
When you treat discovery as a fluid conversation, you disarm your stakeholders, draw
them in, and lower the emotional wall.
This is where dual process combined with strategic and artful questions is especially
powerful. It is not in the nature of stakeholders to allow sellers below the surface. You
can't force it. You've got to stand in their shoes from a place of empathy, and build your
questions organically, in the moment, based on the flow of the conversation, while
remembering your call objective and targeted next step.

Ask Easy Questions First
Imagine you see a stranger from a distance walking in your direction, a man you don't
know. He's making a beeline right toward you. As he comes to a halt in front of you,
your guard is up. Then, without hesitation, he begins peppering you with personal
questions:


Where do you live?



What's your mom's name?



How many kids do you have?



What are their names?



Where do they go to school?



What color car do you drive?



Where is it parked?

How does this line of questioning feel? What will you say? Will you give him the
answers he's looking for? Will you lie? How long would you stand there before
screaming at him to get away from you or before running away?
This is how a stakeholder feels the first time she meets an interrogator who begins
blasting her with difficult questions. She knows that the salesperson's motivation is, first
and foremost, to sell her something. She believes the salesperson is only asking
questions to uncover a weakness that will be exploited. She does not want to be or feel
manipulated.

It is human nature to put up an emotional wall when strangers start asking difficult,
intrusive questions. In your role as a salesperson you are the stranger. When you ask
questions that make your stakeholders uncomfortable, before you have established an
emotional connection and trust, their emotional wall goes up, and they shut down.
The key to breaking through the stakeholder's emotional wall and activating the selfdisclosure loop is beginning the sales conversation with questions that are easy for
them to answer and that they will enjoy answering.
Difficult questions require complex answers or cause stakeholders to feel uncomfortable
or vulnerable to manipulation. Easy questions are not too personal or probing and make
it comfortable for stakeholders to begin telling their story.
Avoid wasting the stakeholder's time with cheesy questions about some random object
on their desk, or the weather, or other nonsense. This just makes you look and sound
like every other average salesperson. In this pattern, you trigger the reflexive buyer
script, and your conversation remains on the surface and will stall—especially if you're
dealing with directors and analyzers.
When I'm meeting with a potential client for the first time, I often ask, “How long have
you been working here?” If they say 20 years, it gives me the opportunity to compliment
the accomplishment (which makes the person feel important). Then I follow up with “I
bet you've seen a lot of changes around here!” and with that the floodgates usually
open.
On the other hand, if they say six months, I ask, “What made you decide to work here?”
In this case I learn about their motivations, career aspirations, and background. This
opens the opportunity for a wide array of follow-up questions, which again, makes my
stakeholder feel important, keeps them talking, and pulls their emotional wall down.
Common ground is another source of easy questions. If you both have something in
common—you went to the same school, live in the same neighborhood, know the same
people, have the same hobby, love the same sports team, and so forth—you'll have a
natural jumping-off point for easy questions. You'll also trigger their similarity bias and
move into their in-group.
The pitfall with common ground is when, instead of allowing your stakeholder to talk,
you take over the conversation. You begin pontificating on the subject with the illusion
that your stakeholder will perceive you as knowledgeable.
When discussing a subject that you have in common with a stakeholder, ask intelligent
questions related to the subject so the other person does the talking. Trust me on this:
people don't want to listen to you talk; they want to listen to themselves talk.
The more you become genuinely interested in what your stakeholders are saying, the
more valuable and important they feel. The better they feel, the more they will want to
talk. The more they talk, the more connected they will feel to you. As you connect, you
gain the right to ask the deeper, more strategic questions that get below the surface and
challenge the status quo.

The Power of Open-Ended Questions
Here is a fact: the more questions you ask, the more sales you will make. Of course, as
we learned from Joe the interrogator, discovery is more than just asking questions. It's
about asking the right questions and the right questions are open-ended questions.
Open-ended questions like “How is that impacting you?” or “What happens when your
workers' compensation costs increase?” encourage stakeholders to talk and elaborate
—to tell stories.
Conversely, closed-ended questions like “How many of those do you use?” or “Are you
happy with that?” elicit short, limited responses. Closed-ended questions are selfserving and interrogative because they are focused primarily on you getting only the
information you need to rev up your pitch.
Most salespeople have at least a rudimentary understanding of open- and closed-ended
question types. If you were to interview 100 sales professionals, 99 of them would tell
you that open-ended questions are most effective in sales conversations. Yet, if you
were to observe these same salespeople interacting with stakeholders, you'd mostly
hear interrogating, closed-ended questions.
Closed-ended questions become habitual because they're easy, give you the illusion of
control, require little intellectual effort and even less emotional investment. Salespeople
who find it hard to ask open-ended questions:


Are unable to manage their disruptive emotional attachment to always being
in control.



Are unwilling to let go and just allow the conversation to happen with the faith
that their stakeholder will reveal key information inside the context of the
story.



Lack the discipline to focus their attention on the other person.



Find it easier to ask closed-ended questions that elicit bullet points rather
than listen to stakeholder stories.

In sales, 99 percent of your questions (and questioning statements like “Tell me more”
or “Walk me through that process”) should be open-ended. I'm especially fond of the
statement and pause approach for getting prospects to talk. I'll say something like
“Wow, it sounds like that's been really challenging.” Then I pause and allow silence to
do the rest of the work.
This technique serves me in two ways. First, it demonstrates that I am listening (active
listening), and second (and most important), the other person almost always fills in the
silence with a story.
The objective of the open-ended question is to elicit stories. Within these stories you
gain access to the information you need to build your case, and insight into what is most
important to your stakeholder. It is through these stories that stakeholders teach you
their language (more on language in an upcoming chapter).

Avoid the Pump and Pounce
Average salespeople believe that to be in control of the sales conversation they must be
doing the talking. They have the annoying tendency of pumping their buyers and
stakeholders for information with interrogating, closed-ended questions and then
pouncing on the first opening to start pitching.
The most destructive sales behavior during discovery is the pump and pounce. Born
from impatience and poor impulse control, this one habit will cause you to miss
important clues, damage relationships, and lose out on sales.
Here's how it works. During discovery, in response to a question, your stakeholder says,
“We've been having a hard time with (fill in the blank).”


If you are an average salesperson, you'll see the admission as an
opportunity to pounce and start pitching solutions.



If you are an ultra-high performer, you'll make note of this potential
opportunity and, based on your call objective, you'll either follow the path and
ask deeper follow-up questions to get the full story or save/leverage this
issue for a future meeting.

As you uncover problems and opportunities, you'll come face-to-face with the temptation
to pounce and pitch a solution. You must regulate this disruptive emotion because as
soon as you start pitching, your ears turn off and so does your stakeholder.
Ultra-high performers leverage discovery to build their case. They patiently ask
questions, encourage stakeholders to talk, and get all the information on the table
before formulating any recommendations or offering solutions. In longer-cycle sales,
discovery may span many meetings with multiple stakeholders before any presentation
or recommended solutions are offered.
Ultra-high performers know that the person asking the questions is in control.

Fluid Dual Process Discovery
The key to discovery is asking the right questions, at the right time, with the right intent.
In sales conversations, the questions you ask should support your effort to maintain an
emotional connection, build your case, and move to the next step. It is a dual process—
empathy and outcome.
Multiple generations of salespeople have learned and been trained on the SPIN
methodology for discovery. SPIN selling, 2 developed by Neil Rackham and codified in
his book by the same name, is the most popular discovery framework of all time.
Rackham based SPIN selling on a well-documented study that indicated that sales calls
are most successful when the salesperson is asking questions and the stakeholder is
talking.

What Rackham theorized from his findings is that the most successful salespeople were
asking specific types of questions, in a specific sequence. The acronym SPIN stands for
four types of questions and the order in which they are asked:
1. Situation questions are helpful for gathering and qualifying facts and data,
and understanding the prospect's current state.
2. Problem questions uncover the prospect's problems and opportunities.
3. Implication questions help uncover the pain the problem is causing.
4. Need-payoff questions task the stakeholder with defining the benefit of
solving the problem—generating self-awareness for the need to change.
More recently, author Deb Calvert's extensive research, much like Rackham's revealed
that salespeople who talk less, ask questions, and listen have a higher probability of
performing ahead of their peer group. From her research, Calvert developed her
DISCOVER Questions® framework.3
The DISCOVER acronym stands for:


Data questions are used to gather facts.



Issue questions are used to probe for problems and pain.



Solutions questions introduce alternatives and awareness of new ideas.



Consequence questions draw attention to risks, concerns, and challenges of
not acting.



Outcome questions reveal stakeholder expectations.



Value questions organize stakeholder priorities.



Example questions create self-awareness that problems exist by drawing out
contrasts.



Rationale questions reveal how decisions are made.

A good working knowledge of both SPIN and DISCOVER will help you ask more
effective questions. These books and methodologies will make you better. The value of
both the SPIN and DISCOVER frameworks is they guide the process of crafting more
effective questions.
The downside, though, is that in the hands of average salespeople, these questioning
frameworks can quickly devolve into linear interrogations rather than fluid
conversations.
Salespeople can become so focused on the type of question they are supposed to be
asking that they disconnect from the conversation, causing their questions to feel
disjointed and manipulative. Average salespeople are often caught contemplating their
next question rather than listening.
Ultra-high performers, operate on a much different level. They leverage a more
advanced Dual Process Discovery Framework. This framework relies heavily on being

in the moment with your stakeholder—empathy, emotion, and attention—while moving
the conversation toward the targeted next step.
It begins with broad, open-ended questions and continues with subsequent probing
questions, leading to a natural point in the conversation at which you bridge to and ask
for the next step. The Dual Process Discovery Framework (Figure 23.1) is
conversational rather than interrogational.

Figure 23.1 Dual Process Discovery Framework
Average salespeople are more comfortable with a linear questioning process because
it's easier to plow through a checklist of questions than to truly listen and make an
emotional investment in the conversation. It's easier to pump just enough information
out of their stakeholder and pounce on the first opportunity to pitch.
Effective questions should activate the stakeholder's self-disclosure loop early in the
conversation. The key is getting out of the way and allowing nature to take its course.
Rather than the common practice of asking one interrogating question after another
from a predetermined list, a conversation is organic, building on itself. Fewer questions
are asked but uncover far more information.
Ultra-high performers leverage the Dual Process Discovery Framework because it gives
them maximum flexibility to adjust their questions strategically as the conversation

unfolds. This nonlinear framework opens multiple avenues of questioning, allowing
UHPs to gain access to the stakeholder's emotions, flip the buyer script, and gain a
clearer picture of the problems, pitfalls, and issues that lie below the surface.

Developing Go-To Questions
UHPs seem to know exactly what to ask at exactly the right moment while remaining
engaged with the stakeholder. They never appear to be working very hard to come up
with their next question or to keep the conversation moving and the stakeholder
engaged.
UHPs keep sales conversations fluid and in the moment with go-to questions. Go-to
questions are deeply ingrained and may be accessed in the moment within the context
of the conversation. The questions may be repurposed, re-formed, and reframed
depending on the situation and direction of the conversation.
The sales process is situational: different industries, different products and services,
different cycles, multiple levels of complexity, different stakeholders, and different
salespeople. Therefore, questions must flex to the moment.
Great questions are artful. Sometimes they are just simple statements with a pause that
elicits responses to fill in the silence. Artful questions are provocative. They cause the
stakeholder to think and become self-aware of the need to change. Artful questions
naturally build on the conversation rather than being separate from it. They must match
the moment and cannot be scripted.
Strategic questions are well placed within the conversation and are aligned to the
overriding sales strategy and moving to the next step. Ultra-high performers are
strategic and outcome focused, always thinking three to five moves ahead on the
chessboard.
Developing the ability to ask strategic and artful questions that match the moment
requires a high Sales EQ. You must leverage empathy, situational awareness, attention
control, emotional control, and confidence.
It begins with an intentional effort to internalize your go-to questions. When I first started
out, my sales manager handed me two pages of questions. The questions were not
organized in a useful way and did not match my speaking style. On sales calls I
sounded like a robot, reading one question after another. But this list was all I had.
It was a starting point. I read and studied SPIN, and over time I organized the questions
into a better format and rewrote them to match my speaking style. This is essential
because, to be conversational, your questions and questioning statements must sound
like you. I also became a collector of questions:


When you hear a question that resonates with a stakeholder, write it down
and remember the context.



Interview and observe the UHPs in your company, and collect their best
questions. Notice how they ask those questions—voice inflection, body
language, tone, style, and context.



Read books like SPIN Selling and DISCOVER Questions Get You
Connected to spark ideas and practice structuring effective questions.



Experiment with different variations of the same questions to find more
effective combinations that work best with your style and allow you to flex to
complement your stakeholder's preferred communication style.



Focus on situational awareness and learn when you should and should not
ask certain questions.



Be strategic. Consider the potential answers to certain questions. Then
develop follow-up questions in response to each potential answer. This helps
you remain in the moment, because you never need to think about what you
will ask next.



If sales were football, questions would be the plays. Following sales
conversations, review the questions asked and their effectiveness—much
like reviewing a game film. Keep the ones that worked and change or adjust
the ones that did not.

When you follow this process, over time you'll develop your own set of go-to questions:
questions that work for you, sound like you, and allow you to flex to and be in the
moment.
Never, ever forget that, in sales, a question you ask is more important than anything
else you'll ever say.

Author's Note
I'm asked often why I don't provide lists of questions in my books or even my training
programs.
The sales process is situational. The questions you ask will be and should be unique to
your product, industry, account, and be stakeholder specific. That doesn't mean that you
won't use the same questions again and again. You will. It would be impossible for me,
though, to develop enough questions to cover even a small segment of the market.
Instead I would leave you with generic questions that would do you little good.
In my Sales EQ trainings and workshops, I (and our trainers) work with participants to
develop, frame, and structure go-to questions that are specific to their unique situation.
I've found that when you actively participate in developing your own questions they
become a part of you and easier to access in the moment when you need them. That is
the point of dual process questioning.

I've provided free resources at https://www.salesgravy.com/saleseq to help you build
your own list of go-to questions as well as a question forum where Sales EQ members
may trade ideas on great questions.

DO YOU MAKE ME FEEL IMPORTANT?
Many a man would rather you heard his story than granted his request.
—Phillip Stanhope
Recently while leaving an initial discovery meeting with a potential client, the company's
director of sales, Sid, who'd been in the meeting, asked me if I had a few minutes to
talk. We walked into his office and he offered me a chair, but before he even sat down
he spit out an emphatic “How did you do that?”
“Do what?” I responded (not letting on that I knew where he was going).
“What you just did in that room.” He pointed behind him. “No one has ever come in here
and held the attention of our executive team like that. Usually, when vendors come in,
Jacob [the company's CEO] checks out in the first few minutes and spends the rest of
the meeting on his phone. He never took his eyes off you. Where the hell did you get all
of that information?”
To him, what I'd done appeared to be some sort of Jedi mind trick. Although I'd never
met any of the people on the executive team, I addressed each person by name when
they walked into the conference room.
Over the course of the meeting I asked questions focused on the unique issues that
each department head was facing while praising specific accomplishments they'd made.
Though this was the first time I'd ever visited the company, I easily wove the company's
unique language, jargon, and acronyms into my questions, as if I'd been working there
for years.
Sid was in awe, and part of me didn't want to reveal my secret. I wanted him to believe I
was a Jedi master.
I reached into my bag and pulled out a file. Inside was a dossier on each stakeholder
that included a printout of their LinkedIn profile, Facebook page, executive summary of
their department challenges and successes, and questions to ask them.
I explained that a month before the meeting one of my entry-level sales development
reps had done the research for me, pulling from online sources and calling into the
company and asking questions. We'd reviewed the company's news, press clippings,
blog, and press releases.
We role-played the meeting in advance and I practiced asking questions. I'd studied
hard so that I knew each stakeholder as if they were a friend. During the meeting, I
simply interlaced important facts, compliments, and questions based on our research.
I'd spoken to each person in the room in their language, listened, and demonstrated that
I understood them and their problems. This caused them to feel significant and that I
cared about them.

The Most Insatiable Human Need
According to research into human social behavior, in conversations with other people,
humans spend as much as 60 percent of the time talking about themselves. 1 Move
those conversations to social media outlets like Facebook and the number reaches 80
percent or higher.2
Why? Well, it seems that talking and bragging about ourselves makes us feel important.
The most insatiable human need is the feeling of significance or importance. It is the
singularity of human behavior in the first world. Almost everything you and I do, virtually
every behavior, good or bad, is rooted in our insatiable need to feel that we matter.
As we learned in an earlier chapter, talking about yourself—telling your story—triggers a
dopamine drip that makes you feel euphoric. In one study, subjects were even willing to
forgo money just for the chance to talk about themselves. 3 This is why we feel so
emotionally connected to people who listen to us and disconnected from people who
talk at us. We don't feel important when other people have the stage.
This, by the way, is the primary reason salespeople default to taking the stage through
pitching. The need to feel significant is an exceedingly disruptive emotion for
salespeople. On the other hand, when you gain control of this disruptive emotion and
focus on making other people feel important, it gives you a powerful advantage in
influencing their behaviors.

How to Make People Feel Important
Making people feel important requires only that you get out of your self-centered world
and focus on other people.


Use their name (the sweetest sound in the world to them).



Remember something about them—an event, their child's accomplishment, a
special vacation—and bring it up in conversation.



Build people up by making them look good in front of other people.



Say “Thank you” and give sincere appreciation.



Ask for advice and demonstrate that the person is valuable and needed.



Be genuinely interested in and curious about them; by taking time to
research prospects and their companies in advance, you demonstrate that
you value them and their time.



Demonstrate empathy by stepping into their shoes and showing them that
you see and value their perspective.



Listen. We come back to listening time and again. Listening to your
stakeholder's story is the easiest, fastest way to make them feel important.
When your mouth is closed, your ears are open, and you give your compete
attention to the other person, it makes a memorable impression.



Give a sincere compliment.

Abraham Lincoln once said, “Everyone likes a compliment.”
I once worked for a man who had a habit of complimenting everyone he met. He was an
executive running a 2-billion-dollar-a-year business—the big boss. He traveled the
country visiting his company's offices and production facilities. Wherever he went,
people looked forward to his visits.
Everyone from the part-time worker picking up trash in the parking lot to the top
managers received a sincere compliment whenever he was around. They would do
anything for this man.
The key to influencing through compliments is developing awareness of others. Put your
own self-centered thoughts aside, and become genuinely interested in other people.
Notice them.
When you give stakeholders genuine, sincere compliments about a trait, possession, or
accomplishment, you've given them valuable gifts. You make them feel valued,
acknowledged, and important.
Compliments are even more meaningful when they are delivered in front of other
people. When you cast stakeholders in a good light in front of their boss, they'll
remember you. All people have a deep need for approval of their actions and
accomplishments. This need is ongoing and is never satisfied for long.
When I smile and others respond in kind, I like to compliment them with “You have a
great smile.” Each time I do this their grin gets even bigger. Compliment clothes, kids,
awards, children's artwork, or personal traits. If you know people well or have done
research in advance of meeting them, compliment an achievement. Compliment a
decision they've made.
Best-selling author and speaker Brian Tracy says, “People who continually seek
opportunities to express approval are welcome wherever they go.” You'll be astounded
at how far a sincere compliment takes you. When people feel approved of and valued,
you boost their self-esteem. They like themselves more, and because of this, they find
you likable.
Of course, the easiest, fastest, most powerful way to make another person feel
important is to give them your complete attention and listen. When your stakeholder is
the center of attention and telling their story, it makes them feel appreciated, important,
and emotionally connected to you.

The Law of Reciprocity
This past summer while riding a bus in Kyoto, Japan, with my son, we struck up a
conversation with a young Japanese businessman. Conversation might be
overexaggerating. Since we don't speak Japanese and he didn't speak English,
communication was a struggle.

The one thing we found in common was music. We all took turns naming our favorite
bands—thumbs up, thumbs down. We laughed and sneered, sang snippets of songs,
and enjoyed the moment—a brief connection on a hot, crowded bus.
As the bus approached his stop, the young businessman prepared to get off. The bus
slowed and the doors opened. As we bowed to say good-bye, he reached into his
backpack and pulled out a small, wrapped, rectangular box, motioning for me to take it.
At first I politely refused, but he was emphatic that I take the gift, so I smiled, bowed,
and took the box from his hand as he slipped through the open door.
Thirty minutes later my son and I made it back to our hotel room. I pulled the wrapping
paper off the box, curious to see what was inside. When I opened the lid, it wasn't what I
was expecting. Inside were five slices of raw fish wrapped in leaves. I stared into the
box for a moment and then reached in and pulled out a leaf-wrapped piece of fish.
My son turned up his nose as I popped it into my mouth. “You can't eat that!” he
pleaded. “That's raw fish out of some random guy's backpack from a bus. You don't
know what you're putting in your mouth.”
“But he gave it to me as a gift,” I shot back. “I can't waste it. That wouldn't be right. It
was probably his dinner!” Even though my son's argument was rational, I felt a deep
emotional obligation to reciprocate by eating the fish.
But my compelling feeling of obligation was far from over. The moment the young man
stepped off the bus I felt a twinge of guilt. He hadn't given me time to find something in
my bag to give him to repay the favor. Months later it still bothered me. This is the
power of the law of reciprocity.
Robert B. Cialdini, author of Influence, says, “One of the most potent of the weapons of
influence around us is the rule for reciprocation. The rule says that we should try to
repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.”
In layman's terms, the law of reciprocity simply explains that when someone gives you
something, you feel an obligation to give value back. But as Cialdini explains, the rule or
law of reciprocity goes much deeper than this. This feeling of obligation, the need to
reciprocate, is baked deeply into human psychology.
Imagine what our world would be like if we didn't feel the obligation to reciprocate.
Society would break down because no one would do anything for anyone else. Why
should they? There would be nothing given in return, nor would there be any penalty for
taking without giving. The law of reciprocity is the glue that holds human society
together.
Epp Wilson has a firm grasp of the influence the law of reciprocity has on human
behavior. He deftly leverages it with his clients. His company, Foxboro, builds high-end
fences. His crews are well trained and have a reputation for quality.
But, says Epp, “Sometimes we make a mistake, cut down a favorite bush or tree, or
there is a flaw in the fence that our customer finds before we do.”

This can be a problem when a customer has just spent $50,000 or more on a fencing
project.
“When my salesperson is working with the prospect in the initial discovery stages, we
try to find a project on their property that's important to them for which they don't have
the budget. It could be tree removal, filling in a hole, clearing a drainage pond, or fixing
a ditch. We make a note of it and once the contract is signed we do the project at no
cost. Of course, our customer is thrilled.”
Doing more than promised takes advantage of the law of reciprocity. It generates
goodwill and many referrals. It also helps when issues arise; Epp explains, “Customers
repay the gift. They're more reasonable and open to solutions. Instead of a fight, they
give us respect and the room to address the issue.”
A closing note on reciprocation. Even though when you give to others they will feel an
obligation to give back, some people may never return your goodwill. This is why the
deliberate pursuit of reciprocity (in other words, approaching reciprocity as a quid pro
quo—I give value to you; therefore, you give equal or greater value back) does not
work. Doing so will leave you jaded and frustrated because the expectation of
reciprocation is merely premeditated resentment.

Obligation and Win Probability
The gift of significance and the feeling of obligation it engenders is one of the keys to
improving the win probability of your deals.
You'll recall that advancing deals through the pipe and creating velocity is accomplished
through a series of micro-commitments. Each time your stakeholder agrees to a microcommitment, win probability increases.
The need to feel important is so insatiable that when you make people feel important,
you give them the greatest gift you can give another human being. This gift is one of the
cornerstones of influence. By making a person feel important, you create a
subconscious feeling of obligation to reciprocate, and with that you gain the power and
influence to shape their behavior.
Your gift triggers a subconscious feeling of obligation. The stakeholder's feeling of
obligation increases the probability that when you ask for the next step or microcommitment, the stakeholder will repay your gift with both engagement and a yes.
Mary Kay Ash, founder of Mary Kay cosmetics, said that you should “Pretend that every
single person you meet has a sign around their neck that says, ‘Make me feel
important.’ Not only will you succeed in sales, you will succeed in life.” Simple.

DO YOU GET ME AND MY PROBLEMS?
Is there a greater sin in sales than boring your audience?
—Mike Weinberg
My new client was insistent that I was wrong and, having pushed the issue so hard, I felt
I was treading on thin ice with our fledgling relationship. I'd been trying to make the point
that my client's focus on competitive differentiation was doomed to failure. The debate
centered on the marketing organization's desire to develop a consistent sales pitch that
would be supported by a bevy of marketing collateral.
Just prior to our argument, the marketing team had delivered a dog-and-pony show of
brochures, presentation decks, and digital sales media.
There'd been buzzwords, complex-sounding jargon, and pretty images all delivered with
the smugness and arrogance of highly compensated, well-educated marketing
professionals who were completely delusional about what it actually took to engage
prospects and close deals in their highly competitive industry.
The marketing team was gravely concerned that the salespeople didn't have a
consistent message and, in the words of the vice president of marketing, “had no idea
how to articulate the company's points of competitive differentiation.”
My pushback was blunt. The company didn't have a messaging problem. It had an
engagement problem. The account executives were failing, not because they were
unable to articulate a clear message, but because they articulated it too much. The
account executives were talking stakeholders to death. Worse, the account executives
were boring because their pitch was identical to that of each of the company's major
competitors.
“Jeb, I hear what you are saying, but our product is superior to our competitors,” the
product manager responded. “Our problem is the salespeople don't know how to show
potential customers the difference. We need them to teach potential customers what
makes our software better.”
There was a major disconnect. I'd spent the previous week shadowing and observing
their salespeople. The account executives, armed with iPads loaded with interactive
brochures, pitched and pontificated. They recited facts and figures, presented case
studies, and challenged their prospects with insights.
But all the challenging and teaching and insight selling wasn't working. New sales were
flat, and the company was in danger of losing market share. Leadership was panicking,
and the brand and product managers were under the gun. They were looking for a
lifeline.
That's where I came in. They'd hired me to help them hone the message and teach their
salespeople how to articulate it. They believed the solution to the problem was an even

better pitch—one that would wow stakeholders into submission. However, the marketing
team had already made up their minds and were in no mood to listen.
Sensing that I was in jeopardy of losing my new client if I pushed harder, I asked if I
could come back with some recommendations for messaging the following week.

You Can't Differentiate When Everything Looks the Same
On a rainy Friday morning a week later, the team gathered in the executive conference
room. On the table, I'd placed sales collateral along with hard copies of websites and
landing pages from their three biggest competitors. We even had tablets with the
explainer videos from each competitor loaded and ready to play. Alongside them we
placed copies of my client's marketing material and messaging.
At first the folks on the project team were like kids in a candy store, fascinated by having
so much of their competitors' marketing materials right at their fingertips. I was intrigued
that they hadn't taken the time to do this already.
I left them to it for a few minutes before instructing, “Everyone, please take a step back
from the table and look at all of the messages as a whole. Tell me what patterns you
see.” The large conference room became instantly silent while they took it all in. No one
said a thing. Then a marketing manager murmured, “They're all the same.”
This ignited an intense conversation that became a pivot point to much-needed deep
introspection. They'd been so inwardly focused and such ardent believers of their own
press clippings that they were blind to the truth. Rather than looking at all the facts,
they'd conveniently cherry-picked only the data that proved their point.
It was a classic example of the human confirmation bias at work. The marketers sought
out data that supported their conclusion that the salespeople were unable to
differentiate while ignoring evidence that pointed to alternate explanations.
It was a rude awakening to an uncomfortable and inconvenient truth. To stakeholders,
they and every competitor in their industry were indistinguishable.
How could my client differentiate when their salespeople, messaging, collateral,
advertising, website, and even images and videos looked, sounded, and felt the same
as those of their competitors?
It was no wonder that most sales conversations quickly degenerated into price
negotiations. Talking more would not solve their differentiation problem.

The Age of Transparency
We live in the age of transparency where anyone can get information about anything
with a few clicks and swipes on a screen. Information is ubiquitous. It's also confusing.
Consider what a person who is researching potential vendors for the software my client,
from the previous story, sells. What will they find?


Four companies offering what appear to be identical products



Four companies making the same promises



Four websites that are strikingly similar



Four blogs with carbon copy articles and themes



Four free guides on four indistinguishable landing pages



Four look-alike “me too” explainer videos

Often, research confuses more than it informs. The stakeholder, no better off than they
were before they did their research, requests meetings with account executives from
each company.
The account executives recite messaging and regurgitate stock presentations
developed by the MBAs in their marketing department. Each AE making a convincing
pitch that their software is far superior.


Four meetings with account executives—all essentially the same

How does the stakeholder choose?
Many companies and salespeople delude themselves into believing their product or
service is so unique or different that it sells itself. If you are in this camp, it is time for a
reality check. To stakeholders you and all your competitors look, sound, and act exactly
the same. If your product is so good it sells itself, I suggest warming up your résumé
because your company is going to quickly figure out that they don't need you.
Here's the brutal truth: To differentiate, YOU must be different.
If you strip all the complexity away from sales, you will find that sales is, at the core, just
one person solving another person's problem. Stakeholders become emotionally
attached and extremely loyal to salespeople who demonstrate that they get the
stakeholder and their unique problems and bring custom-crafted solutions to the table
that solve those problems.
Problem solvers are the champions of the business world.

Do You Get Me?
Close your eyes for just a moment and picture a person in your life who really gets you
—a person who understands who you are and what you are about. Think about that
relationship. What's it like? How does it feel? Is it:


Nonjudgmental?



Comfortable?



Accepting?



Open and transparent?



All of the above?

When you are with someone who gets you, you share a unique language. You laugh at
jokes no one else gets. You exchange ideas and thoughts with just an expression. You
each know what the other person is thinking—almost like you have ESP. You have the
same ideas at the same time and finish each other's sentences.
There is something special that happens when other people understand us. Of all
relationships, the ones where the other person gets you are the most cherished.
Clearly, it is nearly impossible to duplicate the level of get that you have with a sister,
parent, lover, or best friend in a commercial relationship with a stakeholder. However,
the same emotions and influence dynamics are at play. All human beings, at their core,
want to be understood.
In B2B sales, stakeholders are using someone else's money to solve their problems.
Those problems are personal and real. Each stakeholder believes that their situation is
unique. Even if you've seen the same problem a dozen times before, if they sense that
you are treating their belief that they are different with indifference, they'll disconnect
emotionally.
The generic kitchen-sink data dump pitch that makes you sound like a walking, talking
marketing brochure tells them loud and clear that you don't and haven't taken the time
to understand them. That you are too lazy or self-centered to care enough to see them
as unique.
In commercial relationships, the way you demonstrate that you get your stakeholders is
through personalized recommendations to solve their problems, remove pain, or
capture opportunity. These recommendations must be delivered using their language
and be relevant to what is most important to them.
When you speak their language, you look, feel, and sound different from your
competitors and you gain influence over buying behaviors.

People Buy for Their Reasons, Not Yours
During a top-to-top meeting with a prospect's executive team, Penske's COO, Art
Vallely, and the enterprise account manager who was running the deal were offered a
tour of the prospect's facility. Art and his EAM spent four hours with the prospect's
stakeholders walking through the massive facility, asking questions, learning about their
operations, and getting acquainted with the company's history and values.
“It was fascinating,” said Art. “We left with a much better understanding of their culture,
how they treated their customers, their goals as an organization, and roadblocks that
were holding them back from reaching their goals.”
Using the information gathered on the tour, the Penske sales team crafted a plan to
help their prospect reach those goals. The Penske team focused on helping their
prospect improve customer service—improvements that would have a significant impact
on both customer retention and the bottom line.

Six months later Penske won the deal. After the celebration, Art called the new
customer's executive vice president to thank him. On the call, Art asked him what
swayed him and his team to choose Penske. The EVP's explanation revealed again
why Sales EQ matters.
“We also invited your competitor to take a tour of our facility. They spent less than 30
minutes with us and didn't ask a single question. Their executives spent most of the tour
looking at their phone screens checking e-mail. We got the impression that they weren't
that interested in getting to know us. They were more focused on pitching us on how big
and great they were and how foolish we'd be to do business with anyone but them.
“You and your team spent half a day walking through our operation. You asked great
questions. Everyone on our team felt that you and your people were genuinely
interested in us. We felt like you cared.
“When you delivered your proposal, it was all about us. With your competitor, it was all
about them. That's why we're doing business with you.”
Millions of dollars changed hands in this deal. When the stakeholders at this prospect
weighed the decision between Penske and its competition, they chose Penske, because
the people on Penske's sales team showed interest, invested time to learn and gain
understanding, made the stakeholders feel important, delivered personalized
recommendations based on the prospect's unique situation, and cared more.
Penske's competitor talked at the stakeholders about trucks. They pitched their reasons
the stakeholders should buy—features, benefits, truck specs, competitive differences.
All rational, logical reasons, but not the stakeholder's reasons.
It was not about trucks. The stakeholders at this prospect didn't care about trucks. They
cared about problems that were impacting their ability to deliver best-in-class customer
service.
People buy for their reasons, not yours. To differentiate in the age of transparency, you
must step into your stakeholders' shoes. You must invest time and be curious enough to
learn about their business and problems. You must learn and speak their language.

The Power of Language
Since the dawn of human civilization, language has connected humans, defined
boundaries, and determined who is in and who is out. Today, more than 7,000
languages are spoken across the globe.
Communities, companies, families, religions, clubs, sports teams, schools, and groups
of people in every walk of life and every organizational structure share a common
language that binds them together and creates commonality.
Evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel calls language social technology. 1 He theorizes that
one of the main reasons language evolved in humans was to make it easier to sell
things,2 thus accelerating commerce and eventually creating the modern-day sales
profession.

Pagel asserts that language is a powerful, neural “audio technology for rewiring other
people's minds” because “it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into
someone else's mind.”3
I consider language to be the ultimate sales technology. Language is powerful. Travel
anywhere in the world and even make an attempt to speak another culture's language,
and people will pull you in and embrace you—just for trying. You'll notice how little it
takes. Just a word here or there ingratiates and moves you from stranger to in-group.
In the context of sales conversations, the stakeholders' language is company jargon,
acronyms, processes, systems, and industry terms. It includes their emotional hot
buttons, challenges, issues, concerns, unique problems, situations, and opportunities.
It's the way they express and emote those things. When you learn to speak their
language, it has the same effect. Stakeholders pull you into their in-group.
We've explored, for example, how the similarity bias causes us to believe that people
who are like us are better and more trustworthy. Language transcends differences to
create similarity.
Much like a TV remote control, you can leverage language to “alter the settings inside
someone else's brain.”4 Speaking your stakeholder's language makes your message
and recommendations sound familiar, safe, comfortable, and memorable. This gives
you a distinct competitive edge in the war for differentiation.
During sales training, the trainers rewire your brain to speak your company's language.
You learn elevator pitches, how to dish out value propositions, and how to tell the
company's story. You consume and become familiar with sales collateral and learn how
to talk about products, services, specs, and features—all from your company's (and
your own) perspective. It is total immersion. Over time, you begin to naturally think and
speak in this language.
This is why, it is very difficult to get out of your own head and speak your stakeholder's
language. In our Message Matters workshops and Sales EQ training courses, we put
participants through a simple exercise in which they are required to list common
stakeholder problems and pain points—from the stakeholder's standpoint.
It's excruciating to watch as participants find it almost impossible to step into the shoes
of stakeholders and intuit problems from that point of view. Mostly, the lists the
participants build are just product and service feature dumps rather than the real issues
that are impacting their stakeholders.
It is easier to learn and speak your stakeholders' language when you are standing in
their shoes. This requires an intentional effort to become empathetic to your
stakeholder's motivations, concerns, interests, aspirations, and experience.
Artful questions draw out the stakeholder's story. When you listen deeply and immerse
yourself in your stakeholders' stories, you gain perspective, experience their emotions,
and learn their language.

Message Matters
Once you've learned your stakeholders' language, the next step is to weave it through
your sales messages to demonstrate that you get them.
Whether in initial presentations, sales conversations, demos, presentations, or
proposals, your message must be relevant, compelling, and memorable. It must
demonstrate that you get the stakeholder's unique situation.
Relevance is the critical element. Otherwise it's just white noise, a boring pattern the
stakeholder's brain ignores, and will not remember.
Message matters. An important cognitive shortcut is called the availability heuristic. The
brain values information that can be more readily recalled and considers it to be more
important than information that is more difficult to remember.
The availability heuristic must not be ignored when tailoring messages and
communicating with stakeholders. Memorable equals differentiation. When you speak
your stakeholder's language, your message is easier to recall and therefore carries
more weight in decision making, therefore increasing win probability.
Sadly, average salespeople make egregious messaging mistakes. Like robots, they
mindlessly regurgitate the product feature bullet points learned in sales training,
regardless of relevance.
Their presentations are boring. Average salespeople fail to activate the stakeholder's
brain and grab attention, because they sound like walking, talking marketing brochures.
It's no wonder stakeholders routinely check out during demos and presentations.
Using your stakeholders' language has the added benefit of reducing cognitive load,
making it easier for them to comprehend, assimilate, and remember the information you
provide. It takes the complexity out of listening.
With sales messaging, complexity is your enemy. Complex and unfamiliar language,
riddled with jargon and business-speak, is difficult to remember. When your message is
hard to grasp, your stakeholder's brain stops paying attention and shifts to heuristics
and biases to interpret what you are saying.

The “So What?” Smell Test
One of my early sales mentors taught me the “so what?” smell test in a tough but
memorable way. Prior to big presentations, I'd role-play my message with him. On each
slide and after each message he'd deadpan, “So what?”
“Our product will save you up to 30 percent over what you are spending now.”
So what?
“Our customer satisfaction rate is 96.7 percent.”
So what?
“Our implementation process is seamless and no hassle.”

So what?
He forced me to explain why each point mattered to that specific stakeholder or
stakeholder group based on their unique situation. If I was unable to make the case
from the prospective company's or the individual stakeholder's perspective, the slide,
bullet point, and sometimes entire presentation was scrapped.
It used to infuriate me. I'd push back, argue, and try to make my case, but if it didn't
pass the “so what?” smell test, my message was scrapped.
Yet, as angry and frustrated as it made me, it also made me better and turned me into a
messaging machine. I learned to listen with intent to understand my stakeholders and
then craft messages that were relevant to them, in their language, because I knew I'd
have to eventually get past the stakeholder's “so what?” gauntlet.

The Fine Art of Bridging
When you are explaining, teaching, demoing, challenging, offering insight, or
presenting, you must remain cognizant of your stakeholder's brain's two most pressing
questions:
1. So what?
2. What's in it for me?
You'll recall from an earlier chapter that your stakeholder's attention is managed and
controlled by the amygdala. The amygdala responds to threats and bright, shiny things.
In its quest to keep your stakeholder alive, the amygdala ignores boring patterns—like
scripted presentations—and responds to environmental disruptions.
Your stakeholder's amygdala is the gatekeeper. Every sales message goes through the
amygdala first, which, like my sales manager, uses a harsh “so what?” smell test.
The amygdala is very selfish. When your mouth is moving and PowerPoint slides are
flashing, it only wants to know, “What's in it for me?” If your message isn't new, different,
or disruptive, if it doesn't solve unique problems, eliminate pain, or combat a future
threat, the amygdala won't waste precious cognitive resources on it.
Instead the amygdala zones out and goes back to scanning the environment for
disruptions and your message never makes it to the stakeholder's neocortex. In other
words, if your message is not relevant, the stakeholder's brain is indifferent.
Solving problems, eliminating pain, and helping stakeholders take advantage of
opportunities is how you earn the right to move to the next step and close deals. You
may have the perfect solution, but if your stakeholders can't hear you because you are
not speaking their language or the pattern is boring, you lose.
Ultra-high performers (UHPs) are pattern painters. They activate the amygdala's
attention with messages and stories that are relevant, tightly focused on demonstrating
that they get their stakeholder, and delivered in a language that is easy to understand.

Bridging is the process and art of building the case for doing business with you, by
connecting your solutions to your stakeholder's problems, in the context of what is most
important to them. In their language, not yours.

Bridging is where message meets emotion. Use words, phrases, and stories that
provoke and activate your stakeholder's emotions—typically by relating to painful
emotions like stress, worry, insecurity, distrust, anxiety, fear, frustration, or anger, and
offering them peace of mind, security, options, hope, lower stress, or less worry.
In an earlier chapter I described a study where subjects purchased more French wine
on days when the store played French music. This response is called an affect heuristic.
Simply put, your mood and resulting actions are often affected by another emotional
stimulus. For this reason, bridges framed in emotional language and stories carry more
emotional impact and are therefore more persuasive.

The Three-Step Bridging Framework
Bridging articulates problems, recommendations, and solutions in your stakeholder's
language, leveraging a three-step process (Figure 25.1) that connects current state, a
personalized recommendation, and a future, aspirational state or what's in it for them.

Figure 25.1 Three-Step Bridging Framework
When you tie recommendations and value statements back to the emotional hot buttons
that were disclosed during discovery, your stakeholders will feel valued, important, and
that you get them.
Never forget that each person (and company) views his or her problems, no matter how
common, as unique. For this reason, bridges must be personalized.
Ultra-high performers make the case that they get their stakeholder and can solve their
stakeholder's problems with confident, succinct, personalized bridges. UHPs transform
mundane features and benefits into custom solutions developed for and built around a
stakeholder's unique situation. They reframe product features that seem generic, in a
way that causes the stakeholder to feel that they were crafted just for her.
Here's an example of a bridge. This example is written in informal language as you
might verbally express it during a presentation. (Written documents require more formal
and concise language. You'll find examples of formal bridges on the Sales EQ
membership site.)

frustration over the manual audit process required to manage the invoices of multiple
vendors. Ruben said that it was taking up to 40 hours of labor each month just to keep
up with it, and that was causing a delay in getting more important projects done. Just
last week they missed a deadline on a rebate that cost you $900.”
Personalized recommendation: “For this reason I recommend installing our Express
Invoicing module. This is a cloud-based payables platform that makes it super easy to
manage invoices and payments. It also gives Ruben an easy-to-use dashboard so he
can focus on anomalies rather than a complete audit each month.”
Planned result: “At a minimum, Express Invoicing will save a little more than $37,000
in direct payroll costs. More important, though, it will provide you and all department
heads visibility into the payables that that are impacting your P&Ls. Ruben can get back
to focusing on saving the company money, and you'll have the peace of mind that there

will be no more embarrassing surprises at the end of the month because something was
missed.”
Notice how this bridge communicates a story. It positions the current, untenable
situation in stark relief, offers hope for a breakthrough, and paints a vivid picture of a
better future state.
Let's break this down.

Problem
The problem (challenge, need, pain, opportunity—use any label you please) defines the
current state in your stakeholder's language. Effectively, you are telling their story back
to them and reminding them of their pain or missed opportunities. The most effective
problem statements are specific, emotional, and offer data-driven proof.
The structure of a bridge is designed to activate your stakeholders' brains and pull their
attention toward you, first by engaging the amygdala, which holds the keys to the
cognitive gate. If the amygdala refuses to open the gate, it doesn't matter how well
conceived your message is; you are not getting in.
This is why we begin with a problem or pain. The amygdala is hardwired to respond to
threats, pains, and problems. It also responds to opportunities, but threats come first. It
is not always possible to do so, but when you can, you'll generate more interest when
you position opportunities as a way to stave off threats.

Personalized Recommendations and the Authority Principle
Once the amygdala opens the cognitive gate, you gain access to your stakeholder's
rational brain, the neocortex. Your recommendation connects with and appeals to the
stakeholder's rational and objective side while leveraging the authority principle.
Like social proof, where humans look to the actions of others to decide how to act
themselves, we also allow the directions of those in authority to stand in for our own
decision making and judgment.
We respect authority and follow authority. When an expert makes a recommendation,
it's natural human behavior to accept the recommendation and comply. In his book
Influence, author Robert Cialdini describes this as the authority principle.
Following the guidance of those in authority makes it easier to navigate uncertainty in a
complex world. Uncertainty increases cognitive load and slows us down. To move
faster, we look to experts for advice, directions, and recommendations, to which we very
often comply.
Ultra-high performers take advantage of the authority principle by making
recommendations that deliver the future state the stakeholder is seeking. UHPs
confidently project themselves as subject matter experts and exert that authority to
shape and influence buying decisions.
UHPs confidently say I recommend to express their authority on the matter.

Average salespeople diminish and dilute their authority with more passive phrases like
my company offers or we provide or our product will or an even weaker I'm hoping that.
When there is uncertainty and risk, stakeholders look to you, the expert, to make
recommendations so that decisions are easier and safer for them to make.

Planned Result
The planned result connects the emotional and the rational. The planned result is
aspirational. It should be painted with a vivid brush that describes a better future.

Author's Note
Crafting sales messages is my favorite part of sales. I love playing with words and the
creativeness that goes into developing the perfect message for each stakeholder.
This part of sales is where the information that was gleaned during discovery comes to
life. Though it is far more art than science, there are useful frames like bridging that
make it easier.
A deep dive into the process of developing effective sales messages, sales stories, and
powerful value propositions is beyond the scope of this book. However, you will find

ASKING
THE MOST IMPORTANT SALES DISCIPLINE
A rejection is nothing more than a necessary step in the pursuit of success.
—Bo Bennett
“Um, uh, so,” Bill was stuttering, barely making eye contact with the buyer. He looked
scared. “What, um, do you, uh, think?”
Sitting next to him, I was thinking, Seriously, after all that work the best you can come
up with is “What do you think?” This company needs us, you made the case, you
earned the right, so ask for what you want!
Marla, the buyer, replied, “Thanks for the presentation, Bill. You've given us a lot to think
about. Tell you what. I'm going to run this by my team and we'll get back to you in a
week or so.”
After nurturing the prospect for more than a year waiting for the buying window to open,
six weeks of work to get on Marla's calendar, five discovery meetings, a product trial
and pilot, two solid weeks of work on the presentation and proposal, building a rocksolid business case, and delivering a flawless presentation, Bill blew it with a passive,
weak, nonassumptive ask.
His disruptive emotions derailing him when it mattered most. All he had to show for his
effort was a “call me maybe.”
In sales, you must ask for what you want, directly, assumptively, and assertively. Don't
expect stakeholders to do your job for you. When you fail to ask, you fail.

Closing
I can't get away from salespeople who quiz me about closing techniques and sales
managers who beg me to teach them how to get their salespeople to close.
From superstitions (I'll admit that there was even a time when I would wear my special
closing tie on sales calls) to an endless stream of cheesy scripts, there seems to be no
end to the so-called experts who are quick to claim that they can lift away the mystery to
“closing the deal every time.”
Here's the brutal truth: Those so-called experts are wrong. There is no holy grail of
closing.
Closing requires excellence throughout the entire sales process rather than a point in
time where a manipulative line or tactic moves the prospect to say yes. If you've aligned
the three processes of sales, built an emotional connection with your stakeholders,
asked great questions, bridged to relevant solutions, and answered the five most
important questions, then closing is, more often than not, an anticlimactic formality.

Here's my advice. Forget about closing and focus on asking.


Ask for the appointment.



Ask for the next step.



Ask for the facility tour.



Ask for the information you need.



Ask for the demo.



Ask for the decision maker.



Ask for the sale.



Ask for what you want.



Ask!

Can I make it any clearer? If you are having a hard time getting the next appointment,
getting to decision makers, getting information from stakeholders, leveling up higher in
the organization, or closing the deal, nine out of 10 times it is because you are not
asking. Why? Because nine out of 10 times you are passively beating around the bush,
afraid to hear “no.”

Afraid to Ask
Nothing in sales requires a higher level of emotional control than asking. The most
treacherous disruptive emotion for salespeople is fear. And the greatest fear in sales is
asking, because asking opens the potential for rejection.


Salespeople are afraid to ask for time



afraid to ask for the next step



afraid to ask to speak with other stakeholders



afraid to ask for data



afraid to ask the stakeholder to share their competitors' collateral and
proposals



afraid to ask to go on facility tours



afraid to ask for demos



afraid to level up higher in the organization



afraid to ask for the sale

Rejection is a painful demotivator and the genesis of deep-seated fear, a fear so strong
that it keeps most people from asking for what they want.
Asking conjures up our deepest fears of vulnerability. Vulnerability, according to Dr.
Brené Brown, author of the Power of Vulnerability, is created in the presence of
uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure. Anxiety, stress, a racing heartbeat, sweaty

palms, and a dull brain are all symptoms of the fight-or-flight response kicking in as you
anticipate what might happen if your stakeholder says no.
Getting past the fear of “no” isn't easy. I've been selling my entire life and have been
incredibly successful at it, yet today I still need to remind myself that “no” won't kill me.
That, by the way, is the key. You must first be aware of your fear, and then teach your
rational brain to manage that disruptive emotion.
Start by learning to anticipate the anxiety that comes right before asking for what you
want. Then practice managing your internal self-talk and physical reaction to that fear.
This awareness helps you manage your outward physiology despite the volcano of
emotions that may be erupting below the surface. Like a duck on the water, you appear
calm and cool and project a relaxed, confident demeanor on the outside even though
you're paddling frantically just below the surface.

The Assumptive Ask
Remember emotional contagion? When you are confident with your ask, and assume
you will get what you want, stakeholders respond in kind and give it to you.
When you sound, look, and give off a weak, passive vibe because you are too afraid to
ask directly and assumptively for what you want, you transfer that fear to your
stakeholders and create resistance where it didn't previously exist. In a weird paradox,
when you are more passive, out of concern that being too “pushy” will turn your
stakeholders off, you instead cause them to become resistant to your request.
Jeffrey Gitomer says that “the assumptive position is the strongest selling strategy in the
world.” Ultra-high performers (UHPs) use the assumptive ask because it increases win
probability.
To reduce resistance and get what you want, you must ask confidently, concisely, and
assertively, with no hesitation. There are three keys to asking (see Figure 26.1):
1. Ask with confidence and assume you will get what you want.
2. Shut up.
3. Be prepared to deal with objections.
Ultra-high performers with high Sales EQ believe they are going to win and are
supposed to win. This mind-set of positive expectation manifests itself in their outward
body language, voice inflection and tone, and words. Average salespeople assume
they'll get no. UHPs assume they'll get yes. They exude confidence. That confidence
transfers to stakeholders, compelling them to comply.

Figure 26.1
Whether on the phone or in person, the words you use and how you structure those
words broadcasts loud and clear that you either assume you will get a yes or assume
you'll get a no.

Nonassumptive, Passive, and Weak

Assumptive and Confident

“I'm just checking in.”

“The reason I'm calling is…”

“I was wondering (hoping) if…?”

“Tell me who—how—when—where—what…”

“I have the whole day open.”

“I'm super busy bringing on new clients, but I do have a slot available at 11:00 AM.”

“How does that sound?”

“Why don't we go ahead and get the first delivery set for next Monday?”

“What's the best time for you?”

“I'll be visiting a client not far from your office on Monday. I can pick you up for lunch.”

“I kinda, sorta, was wondering if maybe you have time to

“A lot of my customers are telling me that they're having problems with XYZ. What do you

feel is your biggest challenge?”

“Would this be a good time for you?”

“How about we meet again next Thursday at 2:00 PM?”

“I wanted to find out…”

“Who else do we need to include?”

“How do you feel about this so far?”

“Based on everything you've told me about your current situation, I think it makes sense for
us to go ahead and get a demo set up for next Wednesday. Who on your team should we
invite?”

“What do you think?”

“I'm just going to need your signature on the agreement to get the implementation process
started.”

“How many seats were you thinking?”

“I recommend getting started with our 20-seat bundle. I'll just need the e-mail addresses of
each person on your team to get it set up.”

Stakeholders are subconsciously assessing whether your words, voice tone, and body
language are congruent. When they are not, stakeholders don't trust you, and they put
up resistance.

Shut Up
The hardest part of asking is learning to ask and then shut up. When you've asked for
what you want, you've put it all out there and left yourself vulnerable to rejection. And
what happens when you feel vulnerable? Fight or flight—you get ready to protect
yourself.
In that awkward moment after you ask, your head spins as rejection flashes before your
eyes. The split second of silence is unbearable. It feels like an eternity.
Despite the alarm bells going off in your adrenaline-soaked mind, you must shut up and
give your stakeholder room to answer.
Don't attempt to overcome imagined objections, don't overexplain, don't give your
stakeholder a way out. Don't talk past the ask and thereby convince the stakeholder
who was ready to say yes to say no because of you!
Yes, there will be some no's and maybes, but you'll be surprised at how often your
confident silence produces a yes.

No Surprises
My dad is considered by many of his peers to be one of the top trial lawyers in the
United States. During the summers when I was growing up, he would often take me to
court with him. While watching my dad in court I took away a technique that today, is an
essential step in my sales process.
In court, when presenting or selling their cases to the jury, attorneys never ask
questions for which they don't already know the answers. In other words, by the time
they get to court (despite what you see on TV), there are no surprises.
They make their cases to juries systematically using evidence and witnesses that have
been vetted through pretrial discovery and depositions.

Learning this lesson as a kid paid off for me later as a sales professional. As I applied
the pretrial discovery process to selling, I found that I closed more deals, negotiated
better terms and conditions, and developed stronger relationships. And I was almost
never dealt surprises during presentations or closingmeetings, because I added one
small but powerful step to my sales process.

The Confirmation Step
The confirmation step comes after discovery and before your presentation or demo. You
schedule a short meeting by phone or in person with your stakeholders to confirm and
verify the priorities, problems, pain, and opportunities you uncovered in discovery.
During the confirmation step you allow your stakeholder to correct any mistaken
assumptions you've made, fill in any gaps, and prioritize the issues that are most
important to her. These short conversations, normally no longer than 15 minutes, are
set up like this:
“Hi, Mandy. Thank you for taking so much time to help me learn about you and your
company. I can't wait to show you my recommendations at our meeting next week.
Before I do that, though, I want to be sure that I don't waste your time with unimportant
things. Since I've uncovered a number of opportunities to help you, I was wondering if I
might review my assumptions with you just to be sure I'm on track to help you get what
you want.”
Mandy confirms my assumptions, prioritizes what's important to her, and tells me
exactly what I need to do to close the deal. My call demonstrates that I care about her
needs and concerns, demonstrates my commitment to excellence, and gets me in front
of her one more time before the presentation, which further strengthens my relationship.
I also know that none of my competitors will take this extra step.
Following the confirmation step, I go into presentations and demos with no surprises. I
know exactly which solutions to present, which problems to solve, and on which hot
buttons to focus my attention. I systematically make my case and wow my audience
with my knowledge and understanding of their unique business issues.
By the time I get around to signing the contract, closing the business seems almost
anticlimactic because closing wasn't something I did or some cheesy technique I used;
it was simply a result of understanding clearly what was important to my stakeholders,
building an ironclad case for my solution, speaking their language, and demonstrating
that I understand them.

27
TURNING AROUND OBJECTIONS
No pressure, no diamonds.
—Thomas Carlyle
You're at the end of the sales process. After advancing through a series of microcommitments, you've delivered a masterful presentation and walked the buyer through
the proposal. He agrees that your recommendations to solve his problems will work. It
feels like everything is a go. You ask confidently for his business. Then…
“Well, I'm going to need to think about it.”
Ugh! What do you have to do to get this guy to act? You fantasize about reaching
across the table, grabbing him by his collar and screaming, “Sign the damn contract!”
Instead you present a feeble rebuttal and walk away with a sliver of hope and vague
promise from the stakeholder to “call you sometime next week.”
Objections suck.
Seriously, think about how much better life would be in sales if, when closing, buyers
just smiled and said, “Your proposal sounds great! Where do I sign?”
But that doesn't happen. Instead you get hard questions, pushback, negotiation, and
objections, which trigger a flood of disruptive emotions.
These emotions hit you like a ton of bricks the moment you get an objection. You feel
like you've been punched in the gut. Your brain turns off and you stumble over your
words. You feel embarrassed, small, and out of control. Sometimes you freeze like a
deer in the headlights, paralyzed, unable to formulate any move at all.
Yet, it's here, at this very inflection point of rejection and emotion, that the rubber meets
the road in sales. It's the skill and poise to effectively turn around objections that gets
you to the next step, keeps your deal advancing, and closes the sale.

How Salespeople Create Objections
There is no magic pill that makes dealing with objections easier. When you've got a deal
on the line, especially one that you have invested in heavily, that moment when your
prospect is hovering between yes and no is excruciating and awful.
Life will be much easier, though, if you avoid creating resistance and objections in the
first place. Salespeople create objections and resistance to change because they:


Lack confidence when asking and don't assume they will get what they want.
Since people respond in kind, when you are weak and passive, the
probability that your prospect will respond with an objection like “Let me think
about it” is high.



Fail to build a case for change. Rather than doing deep discovery, asking
questions, and offering unique and personalized recommendations, they
regurgitate generic marketing collateral and hand over a price sheet.



Assume they know what their stakeholder wants and in doing so miss
emotional cues and focus on the wrong issues. People buy for their reasons,
not yours.



Fail to understand the BASIC map and are engaged with a person who is
unable to make a buying decision.



Fail to qualify properly and are working with a low-probability prospect that is
not in the buying window and due to timing, budget constraints, or
contractual obligations does not have the ability to buy.



Fail to align the sales process with the buying process and are closing too
soon or too late.



Are guilty of shallow discovery, winging it, and taking shortcuts.

The most effective ways to eliminate resistance and objections is to follow the sales
process and avoid skipping steps and asking directly and confidently for what you want.
An assumptive, confident ask will break through potential objections where nothing else
will.

Status Quo Bias and Why Buyers Object
Stakeholders throw objections at you because they:


Are afraid of the transition from one vendor to another and the disruption this
might cause for the business and the pain for themselves.



Feel doing business with you is too risky for themselves or their organization.



Hate conflict and are uncomfortable firing their current vendor in order to do
business with you.



Don't trust you.



Did not buy into your recommendation(s).



Have legitimate questions about your proposal.



Are afraid of or uncomfortable with change—they are wedded to the status
quo, no matter how dysfunctional.

Here's a blinding flash of the obvious: humans don't like change. We actively work to
avoid change. We stick to our routines and favorites. We live by the heuristic “If it ain't
broke, don't fix it.” And God forbid, when someone even suggests that a change might
be made, we become anxious, cynical, and rebellious—even if that change is in our
favor.
There is always the underlying fear that a choice to change will be the inferior choice or
will make things worse.

This status quo bias is the number-one reason stakeholders throw out objections and
deals stall in the late stages of the sales process, ending in “no” decisions.
In his book Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, the father of heuristic and
cognitive bias research, writes:
Organisms that placed more urgency on avoiding threats than they did maximizing
opportunities were more likely to pass on their genes. So, over time, the prospect of
losses has become a more powerful motivator on your behavior than the promise of
gains.1
This safety bias causes your brain to be more aware of bad things (what could go
wrong) than good things (what could go right). In evolutionary terms, you might miss the
opportunity for a good thing such as a free lunch. But, if you are not paying attention to
danger in your environment, you could end up being lunch—a very bad thing.
As humans, we tend to be attracted to safe choices and safe environments.
Salespeople, as a rule, are not perceived as safe. You pose a threat. Now, hitch the
safety bias to the status quo bias and you have a formidable emotional wall between
you and the stakeholder you are attempting to influence to make a change.
These pernicious cognitive biases, working in concert, cause your stakeholders'
subconscious to magnify every flaw, every risk, and every concern about you and your
proposition. They feel uncertain, unsure, and afraid. Therefore, they choose staying put,
doing nothing (the status quo) over change. Even in untenable situations in which
change is necessary for survival, people will cling to the status quo: “Better the devil you
know than the devil you don't.”
It's maddening for salespeople who lead thirsty horses to water but come push, shove,
and cajoling cannot make them drink. For salespeople, despite all the concern about the
competition, the status quo is and will always be their most formidable adversary.
In a world driven by relentless, disruptive change, for the risk-averse the status quo is
king. Whether you are trying to persuade others to accept new ideas, influence a
prospect to change vendors, coax a customer to purchase a new product, appeal to a
company to adopt a new system, challenge a team of stakeholders to accept a new
process, or just get to the next step, the greater emotional pull, no matter how illogical,
will always bend back toward the status quo.
Average salespeople respond by fighting back. They default to pushing their
stakeholders to accept change—attempting to argue them into believing that their fears
are unfounded. In doing so, average salespeople confirm the stakeholder's negative
stereotype of salespeople and trigger the safety bias. To avoid the discomfort of this
confrontation, the stakeholder disappears.
Ultra-high performers (UHPs) help stakeholders move past their status quo bias by
helping them acclimate to change though priming and micro-commitments.
An example of the priming process is introducing the stakeholder to the next-step ask
during the sales call agenda rather than surprising them at the end of the call. Priming

change is also accomplished during discovery through questions that allow the
stakeholder to talk about a desired future state.
A series of micro-commitments prepare stakeholders for change. Micro-commitments
are just that, small, easy-to-consume steps. As stakeholders get used to small changes,
it becomes easier for them to make big changes.
Trust, however, is the one emotion that breaks the gravitational force of the status quo.
Although few decisions are completely risk free, trust plays a key role in reducing fear
and minimizing risk for stakeholders. The more they trust you, the higher the probability
they will comply with your requests, accept your ideas, and buy from you.
But if you have failed to build and nurture trust, you'll run right into the status quo wall.
You may have checked every box. You may have answered four of your stakeholder's
five most important questions with a resounding yes!
1. Do I like you? Yes!
2. Do you listen to me? Yes!
3. Do you make me feel important? Yes!
4. Do you get me and my problems? Yes!
5. Do I trust you? No! (win probability zero)
But it won't matter unless you have trust. Trust, above all things, trumps the status quo.

You Cannot Argue Stakeholders Out of an Objection
Traditionally, sales trainers have taught salespeople to “overcome objections.” I often
hear trainers use the phrase “combatting objections.” Overcome means to defeat or
prevail over an opponent.2
Average salespeople attempt to argue stakeholders into changing their minds—to
prevail with debate. This is the reason stakeholders often obfuscate, put up smoke
screens, and lie. They expect when they say no that they'll face a battle and be
disrespected.3
Overcoming doesn't work. It has never worked. Even when salespeople do manage to
get prospects to say yes this way, it is in spite of, not because of, debate that they
prevailed. You cannot argue your stakeholders into believing that they are wrong. The
more you push, the more they'll dig their heels in and resist you.
The act of overcoming (or worse, combatting) creates animosity, exasperation, and
frustration for both the stakeholder, who gets bulldozed with a pitch about why they are
wrong, and the rep, who creates even more resistance and harsher rejection with this
approach.
There is a better way. Ultra-high performers don't view stakeholders as adversaries.
Rather than attempting to prevail in an argument, UHPs leverage the way the brain

works to paint patterns, disrupt the stakeholder's expectations, turn them around, and
pull them in.

Five-Step Objection Turnaround Framework
Everything you've learned in this book is designed to lower the probability that you get
objections. When you've aligned the three processes of sales, mapped and managed
the stakeholder array, advanced your deal through the sales process one next step at a
time, and answered the five most important questions in the affirmative for each
stakeholder, closing the sale gets much easier.
When you've done everything right, most objections are either legitimate questions that
need to be answered or sincere negotiating that is mistaken for an objection. For
example, I love it when a stakeholder says, “Jeb, we really want to do business with you
but….” This means I've closed the deal. The stakeholder has made a commitment to
me. All we need to do is negotiate the “but.”
It's important to remain alert for objections that are really buying signals so that you
don't walk on them.
Ultra-high performers leverage the Five-Step Objection Turnaround Framework (Figure
27.1). When responding to questions, objections, and attempts to negotiate, this
framework serves to help them manage disruptive emotions, isolate the real issue, and
work through it with their stakeholder without doing harm.

Figure 27.1 Five-Step Objection Turnaround Framework

Relate
This step, much like the ledge we use when dealing with reflex responses and brushoffs to next-step responses, serves the purpose of giving your rational brain time to
catch up and gain control of the disruptive emotions generated by rejection.

Buyer “Your prices are high compared to your competitors.”
:
You:

“I get how you might feel that way. They sometimes do seem a little higher than our competitors, and no one wants to pay more than they
should.”

The key is to simply relate to stakeholders, like a human—to get on their side and
demonstrate that you get them. This disrupts their expectation that you will argue with
them—pulling them toward you rather than pushing them away. Relating also gives your
rational brain a chance to catch up and gain control of the disruptive emotions that were
triggered by the perceived rejection.

Clarify and Isolate
To effectively deal with an objection, you must ensure that you are addressing the right
objection and that you and your stakeholder are on the same page. If you aren't
speaking the same language or addressing the right issue, you'll end up going in circles
or mistaking a buying or negotiating signal for an objection.
You:

“I'm just curious. When you say our prices are too high, from your standpoint what does that mean?”

Buyer “It's the monthly rate. You are 10 percent higher than what we are paying now.”
:
Stakeholders are not always clear or straightforward with objections. At times, they are
confused. In some cases, they want to avoid the pain of conflict so they throw out an
objection they feel will shut you down and end the conversation quickly (this is a
common occurrence with the consensus builder style type).
Never, ever assume you know what your stakeholder means. Always clarify. Then
isolate the objection.
Average salespeople have the bad habit of pouncing on the first objection they get.
Unaware that there are multiple concerns, they wear themselves out getting past the
first objection on the table, only to be blindsided by yet another objection.
UHPs always stop and check before moving on to be sure there is nothing else hiding in
the weeds.
You:

“Okay, got it. Other than that, is anything else bothering you about our proposal?”

Buyer “That's it. I'm going to have a hard time justifying the increase in monthly rate to my boss.”
:
Sometimes when you isolate you'll find that the first objection was just smoke. Isolating
reveals the true and pressing concern.

You:

“Okay, got it. Other than that, is anything else bothering you about our proposal?”

Buyer “I just heard from our current vendor that we are facing a significant cost to make a change. Your cost is already more than what we are
paying with them, and I'm not sure I can justify to my boss why making a change is worth it.”
:

Minimize
You cannot argue other people into believing that they are wrong. But this is exactly
what many salespeople do. They view the buyer as an adversary who must defeated or
beaten down to win. This tactic rarely works and when it does buyers often renege on
their commitment once they've had time to reflect on what happened.
The real key to turning around the objection is to minimize your stakeholder's concern or
fear of change. Humans hate change, which is why the status quo has such a powerful
gravitational pull.
You have a powerful influence lever on your side, though, called cognitive dissonance.
Throughout the sales process, you've asked for and your stakeholder has committed to
a series of micro-commitments.
If you did your job in discovery, you created awareness of the need to change and
helped your stakeholder articulate the reasons for change. When you bridged your
solutions to the problems, the stakeholder agreed with your recommendations and
solutions. Along the way, you've collected a pocket full of yeses.
Each time your stakeholder made a new micro-commitment, each time you asked, “Do
you feel this will work for you?” and he said yes, at the subconscious level he moved
into that future state. Yet at the point of decision he wavers, torn between his desired
future state and the perceived safety of the status quo.
To you the decision is rational and obvious, but he is lost in an emotional haze. If you
argue, you push him toward the status quo and you lose the deal. Instead, you must
minimize his fears, accentuate the benefits of change, and allow the pain of dissonance
to shake him from his comfort zone.
You:

“When we were discussing the service issues you were having with your current vendor, you said that those issues are costing you
around $1,100 a month in lost wages and around $4,200 a month in missed sales. Did I get those numbers right?”

Buyer “Yep, that sounds about right.”
:
You:

“You said you felt that the plan I recommended would make it easier for your service team to take care of customer issues which would
improve customer retention.” [Pause to allow the buyer to fill in the silence.]

Buyer “I like the plan, and I do think it will work for us. I'm just concerned about the price of putting it into motion.”
:

You:

“I remember that you said your boss was riding you over the lost sales and that was her most pressing issue, which is why you agreed to
meet with me in the first place. Streamlining the clumsy process and the hoops your customers are forced to jump through just to make a
small purchase will fix the issue immediately. That should make Angela happy, right?”

Buyer “That's why we need to make this change. If we fix the sales problem, she'll be thrilled.”
:
You:

“When I do the math, you are losing $63,600 a year by sticking with your current vendor. Of course, you are right—working with us does
mean you need to build a little bit more into your monthly budget.

“However, once we implement our program and we eliminate the lost sales and payroll costs, you'll save $34,800 a year. Essentially,
making the move is putting money in your pocket.

“Even with the $10,000 your current vendor says it will cost you to make the change, and I believe we can negotiate that down, you get an
ROI of almost $25,000 in the first year.

“I'd say with the improved customer retention, increased sales, and better experience for your employees you've got a good case for
making the change.”

Buyer “Ah, I hadn't looked at it that way.”
:
As you gently remind your stakeholder of what he has already committed to, he feels a
subconscious tug to remain consistent with those commitments. To do otherwise
creates painful cognitive dissonance. This, in turn, makes it easier to break the pattern
of status quo.

Ask
Once you've minimized your stakeholder's objection, you must confidently and
assumptively ask again.
You:

“Based on these numbers, it doesn't make sense to wait, so why don't we go ahead and get this started?”

Buyer “I agree. What are our next steps?”
:
If you wait for your stakeholder to do the job for you, the status quo will come crawling
back in and you'll end up with another “I want to think about it.” Ask directly and
assumptively for a commitment once you've minimized your stakeholder's concern.

Fall Back
Even though you've covered everything, you may still get a no. It is important that you
avoid a pitched battle and that you walk away with an alternate commitment. By
maintaining forward momentum, you avoid a stall.
Buyer “It sounds good, and I think we are almost there. But I need to go over the math one more time before we make this big of a commitment.
Give me a week or so and I'll get back to you.”
:
“I'm going to be back over this way next Thursday. Why don't we get together at 11 AM and make a thumbs-up or thumbs-down decision

You:

then?”

Buyer “Sounds good.”
:
If you end up with a vague “We need to talk this over—how about you give us a call late
next week?” there is a high probability that your deal will stall and die.
You must get something. Be prepared with a fallback request. The request might be for:


Scheduled meeting



Beginning the implementation process



Additional demo



Pilot



Smaller purchase



Alternate product or package

It helps to have your fallback position planned prior to your closing call. In fact, it's a
good idea to practice and role-play all the potential objections you may get, in advance.
Practice the worst-case scenarios—a great activity for the murder board. Put every
potential objection and response on the table and work through the five-step process
until you handle them all with ease.
I've found that practice helps build obstacle immunity, prepares you to manage
disruptive emotions, and makes it far easier to think on your feet, in the moment. You
will also find that when you plan and practice in advance, the actual objections you get
at closing are far tamer than what you initially expected.

DO I TRUST AND BELIEVE YOU?
When the trust account is high, communication is easy, instant, and effective.
—Stephen R. Covey
Despite the perception that salespeople will say or do anything to get the deal, I rarely
meet salespeople who harbor ill intentions. Most sales professionals


Do the right thing,



Keep their promises,



Tell the truth, and



Believe in what they are selling.

The trap average salespeople fall into is the false belief that good intentions are
enough. Stakeholders are not judging your trustworthiness based on your intentions.
Instead they judge you based on their own intentions.
Stakeholders are scrutinizing you. They are looking for congruency in your words,
nonverbal communication, and actions. Listening, demonstrating confidence, keeping
promises, showing up to meetings on time, being prepared, meeting deadlines,
following up, following through, keeping sales material pristine, managing your
message, and so on connect words, intent, and actions.
In our hypercompetitive global market place, dominated by disruptive change, buying a
new product or service or switching vendors carries real risk for stakeholders. Today,
organizations have very little patience for failure and the penalty for making mistakes is
severe.
When stakeholders rely on you to deliver on promises, they put themselves in a
vulnerable position. Buying from you can mean putting their reputation or career on the
line. Likewise, in high-end business-to-consumer (B2C) sales, customers may be
putting their family finances and reputation with their spouse or other family members at
risk. Should you fail to perform, the impact on their business, company, career, or family
could be extreme.
In this stress-filled atmosphere you'd think that stakeholders would rely strictly on
empirical evidence and data when choosing vendors; that they would act in their best
interest, putting emotions aside and doing only what is most logical. But we know this is
not how people make decisions.
Humans almost always act on emotion first and subsequently justify those actions with
logic. This by the way, is why making no change—sticking with the status quo—is often
the emotionally safe choice, even when staying put is illogical or even dysfunctional.

Emotional Baggage
According to a recent Associated Press/GfK poll that asked, “Can most people be
trusted?” 70 percent of the U.S. population believes that most people can't be trusted. 1
Imagine the response if the question were changed to, “Can most salespeople be
trusted?”
Stakeholders bring into sales conversations the emotional baggage accumulated over a
lifetime of dealing with salespeople. Those experiences are amplified by the negative
perceptions about salespeople that have been drilled into them through movies, TV,
stereotypes, and the media. They are suspicious of your motivations from the get-go.
Most stakeholders, though, given enough consistent evidence that you'll listen, care,
seek to understand, keep your word, and do the right thing will trust you. The paradox of
vulnerability is that deep inside we want to trust others. Distrust creates painful
dissonance. Suspicion and skepticism are uncomfortable feelings. Trust is stability—a
state of well-being and equilibrium we seek.
Stephen R. Covey, author of 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, compares the process
of building trust to making deposits in an “emotional bank account.” Using this
metaphor, Covey explains that you build trust by making regular deposits (consistent
evidence that you are trustworthy) in another person's emotional bank account.
As you make deposits, like listening, being prepared for meetings, keeping
commitments, and delivering on promises, the balance in the trust account grows.
When you fail to honor commitments, renege on promises, make the other person feel
unimportant or unappreciated, behave in an unlikable or inconsistent way, you make
withdrawals.
As with any bank account, when you make too many withdrawals and allow your
account balance to become overdrawn, there are penalties. You lose trust, placing the
relationship and deal in jeopardy.

You Are Always on Stage
Imagine standing on a stage in an auditorium. In the audience are your stakeholders,
clients, your boss, and your peers. Every behavior is being watched. You are being
observed to see if your actions are congruent with your words.
Perhaps you are polite to some people, but not others. Perhaps you become agitated at
a minor inconvenience. Maybe you were late to a meeting and did not call in advance.
Could be you didn't return an e-mail or voice mail in a timely manner.
You may have missed a key piece of information in discovery because you weren't
paying attention. Maybe your presentation material or samples were not in pristine
condition. You weren't prepared for the demo. Your business card had coffee stains on
it. You told a little white lie and got caught.
Judgments are being made about how much to trust you. In sales you are always on
stage, and it is essential that you control the behaviors you allow others to observe. You

must exert a tremendous amount of self-control and discipline to manage every
behavior, promise, and action while in front of stakeholders.
Failure to return phone calls, disorganization, spelling and grammatical errors on written
documents, being unprepared for meetings, inaccurate facts, inconsiderate behavior,
distracted listening, and failure to follow up, all seem very small. However, the human
brain gravitates toward the negative.
Negative messages, thoughts, and images grab and hold our attention. We are attuned
to what's wrong about someone rather than what is right. Over time, these small
negative perceptions add up, building the case that you cannot be trusted.
When it comes to trust, little things make a big difference. Although there are situations
in which one big lapse in judgment injures trust to such an extent that there is no going
back, these events are rare. Losing trust is more often the culmination of many small
breaches that weaken or destroy the foundation of trust.

One Brick at a Time
You are not entitled to trust, you must earn it with consistent and ongoing evidence that
you are trustworthy. This is where our journey loops full circle back to the alignment of
the three processes of sales.
You can't show up day one and start challenging stakeholders, telling them what they
are doing or getting wrong. You can't expect to walk in the door or jump on a call, throw
insight and information at stakeholders and expect that they will believe you or view you
as an expert. You must earn that right.
You'll never enter the buying process in the late stages, skipping the crucial Connecting
and Discovery steps and build an adequate foundation of trust on which to challenge
the status quo and close the sale. It doesn't work this way.
Building trust is a step by step process. Every action, decision, and behavior links to
and directly affects trust—positively or negatively. It is part of the seller and stakeholder
emotional journey within the ever-shifting corridors of the sales, buying, and decision
processes. Trust cannot be rushed. You must patiently lay the foundation, one brick at a
time.
In sales, trust is everything. Without trust relationships collapse and win probabilities
crash. Without trust stakeholders erect emotional walls, discovery is shallow, next steps
are denied, objections become immovable obstacles, and deals stall. Without trust, you
have nothing.

AMACHE
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
—Robert Frost
One of my great mentors taught me that when you are at a crossroads and have difficult
decisions to make about how to spend your time or which path to take, you should
choose the thing you will remember most. This advice—choosing the path you will
remember—has in many ways shaped my life and become my mantra.
It was this mantra that caused me to stop and consider turning onto a one-lane dirt
road, late on a blazing hot summer afternoon, deep in the middle of nowhere in eastern
Colorado.
The dirt road stretched as far as I could see. Along the left side was a long line of
cottonwood trees. To my right was an old wooden sign, covered in vines, that just a few
minutes before, caught my eye. Carved into the sign was the word AMACHE.
I took my foot off the brake and the car slowly rolled forward. As it picked up speed, a
dust plume rose behind me, obscuring everything in my rearview mirror.
It seemed like I'd been driving forever when the road abruptly came to a dead end. As I
stepped out of the car and surveyed my surroundings, there was no evidence of what
had happened on that spot more than 70 years earlier. Except for a small, tin-roofed
pavilion that housed historical signs and placards, there was nothing—no other cars, no
other people, only silence.
I walked over to the pavilion, started reading the markers, and immediately became
engrossed in the story of Amache—so engrossed that I didn't hear the car pull up next
to mine, didn't hear the person walk up behind me, and was startled by the frail voice
that said, “I was here.”
I turned around to find an old Japanese man leaning on a cane. “Excuse me,” I
muttered.
“I was here,” he said again.
“Here?” I responded, pointing at the ground.
He nodded, “Yes. I was brought here as a child.” He explained how he and his family
had been ripped from their home in Southern California, put on a train, and shipped to
the Japanese internment camp, Amache, during the early part of World War II.
Standing before me was living, breathing history, and again I was faced with a decision:
whether to focus on my reading or give my attention to a stranger. I made the choice to
get to know the stranger.

This was the first time he'd returned to Amache. His children had pushed him to take the
trip, and he'd driven himself all the way from Los Angeles.
Even though there was nothing left of the camp, he walked me along the worn pathways
in the scrub brush and drew a vivid picture of what Amache was like when he was there.
He talked, we walked, and I listened.
I asked him if he and his family were bitter and angry at their own country for betraying
them in such a horrible way. He said, “We were angry but not bitter. We never talked
about it like that. Instead, we used the experience as motivation to raise ourselves up
and become as successful in America as we could.”
They'd lost everything. Starting from scratch, they had to build their lives all over again
after the war while being treated as third-class citizens and enduring prejudice, racism,
and hate.
“But,” in his words, “we took advantage of our opportunities and that's how we got
even.” He'd built a successful business that became the foundation for his children's
success. Three were doctors, one a dentist, and the other a successful entrepreneur.
After an hour or so, our conversation came to a natural stopping point—that awkward
place where two strangers, who'd become instant friends but would likely never see
each other again, had to say good-bye.
I thanked him for spending so much time teaching me about Amache. I reached out to
shake his hand but instead of taking my hand, he wrapped his arms around me and
gave me a hug. Tears were trickling down his face as he thanked me again and again
for listening to his story.
The experience proved to me, once again, the power of listening. When you listen to
other people, it creates deep emotional connections because it makes them feel
significant and important. You should never forget, when working with others, that no
one ever complains about people who listen.
The mother of listening and human connections is empathy. Empathy is the meta-skill of
the twenty-first century. When you master empathy, you master human relationships.
You stand out. You gain a competitive edge. Empathy pulls people toward you, compels
them to help you, and opens the gateway to influence.
I want you to remember Maya Angelou's words: “I've learned that people will forget what
you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made
them feel.”
As I left Amache and turned back onto the paved road, it hit me how profound the
experience had been. I felt so fortunate to have had such a rare opportunity to walk
through history with someone who participated in it.
The conversation with the old Japanese man inspired me to learn more. A year later I
found myself in Japan at Hiroshima and Nagasaki on a personal quest to understand
the war in the Pacific and how it led to the decision to lock up American citizens in
camps like Amache.

But what kept coming back to me again and again on my walk through history was the
old man's spirit of gratitude. This, I believe, is the greater lesson from Amache: that we
are not defined by what happens to us but rather by how we respond to what happens
to us.
Everyone faces adversity. It is inescapable and often unexpected. You can choose to
believe that the world is conspiring against you or you can be grateful for the opportunity
to learn and grow.
Grateful people feel both blessed to have been given opportunities and tasked with a
deep responsibility to squeeze everything possible from those opportunities. Bitterness,
cynicism, and entitlement cannot grow where gratitude is present.
What I've learned from traveling the world and meeting incredibly successful people
from every walk of life is that gratitude is the secret sauce of success and happiness.
The key to cultivating gratitude is simple and free. You must practice and be intentional
about being thankful.
I spend a lot of my time with ultra-high performers. It's one of the benefits of being a
professional speaker. UHPs are a blast to hang out with. They're fun and uplifting, make
a ton of money, view the world around them through a lens of infinite possibility, and are
unmistakably grateful.
Gratitude is the cornerstone of a winning mind-set and the spark that ignites selfmotivation. It is an appreciation for what you have, what you have been given, your
opportunities, lessons learned through failure and adversity, and the help others have
given you along the way.
Gratitude is associated with increased levels of energy, optimism, motivation,
happiness, and empathy, all of which are keys to developing a high Sales EQ.
In his book A Whole New Mind (Riverhead, 2005), Daniel Pink makes the case that
people who master empathy and interpersonal skills will have the competitive and
economic edge in the coming decades. In the age of bots and artificial intelligence,
emotional intelligence is at a premium.
Sales professionals who invest in and focus on developing Sales EQ will dominate the
profession. When you raise your Sales EQ, you rise above the old paradigms that hold
average salespeople back.
Go look in the mirror. That person you see staring back at you is the real key to ultrahigh sales performance. You control your destiny. The only question you must answer
is: How badly do you want it?

In my life, nothing is possible without Carrie. One moment she's holding my hand at the
doctor's office because I'm a pathetic wimp, the next moment she's organizing book
signings and being kind to fans, then she's making sure I show up where I'm supposed
to with the information I need to rock my next keynote. She runs everything in our
rapidly growing business and for some strange reason always knows where my keys
are. When we're not working, I get to be her husband. Infinite words could never
express how grateful I am that God picked me for you.
Thank you Liz, Pete, Lauren, and Lia for everything you have done to make Sales EQ a
